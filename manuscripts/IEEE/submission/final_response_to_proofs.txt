Corrections in list format
-----------------------
Line 16: Delete the word "also"
Line 33: Replace "discovered" with "demonstrated"
Line 39: Replace "learned features in natural signals" with "these learned features"
Line 62: Replace "(Theorem 1)" with "(Theorem 1 and Corollary 1)"
Line 65: Replace "hold for" with "extend to"
Line 73: Replace "More precisely," with "To state things more precisely," and make this sentence begin a new paragraph.
Line 79: Replace "sparse coding." with "the sparse coding problem."
Eq. (2) after line 95: The dash in "$k$-sparse" should be spaced closer, which happens with latex "\text{for all $k$-sparse}"
Line 116: Delete "directly implying Corollary 1"
Line 157: Delete "to combinatorial subsets of supports"
Line 192: Replace "here" with "applied to vectors"
Line 225: Make this paragraph ("We should stress here [...]") and its following paragraph ("A practical implication of [...]") come immediately after equation (8), right before Line 205.
Line 306: Replace "is polynomial" with "is known to be polynomial"
Line 479: Replace "and a discrepancy (error) that scales linearly" with "within an error that scales linearly (or essentially so)"
Line 483: Replace "that sufficiently affirms" with "sufficient to affirm"
Line 489: Replace "identification of dictionaries" with "dictionary identification"
Line 493: Replace the sentence "The new insight offered by [...]" with "The new insight offered by this combinatorial approach allows for guaranteed recovery of some or all dictionary elements even if they are overestimated in number, data cover only a polynomial number of distinct sparse supports, or the dictionary does not fully satisfy the spark condition."
