Dear Editors at Transactions on Signal Processing,

We are submitting the manuscript:

"On the uniqueness and stability of dictionaries for sparse representation of noisy signals"

for your consideration.  We note that editor Prof. Marco Duarte at Signal Processing Letters (SPL-21129-2016) liked the publication but suggested Transactions instead so as to allow for a full explication of the material and proofs.  In the meantime, we have added additional results that strengthen the paper; in particular, Theorem 2, which did not appear in our submission to Letters.

Thank you for your time.

Best regards,
Chris Hillar
Charles Garfinkle
