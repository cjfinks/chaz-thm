Dedication
%I want to dedicate this to my dad. At the same time, I don't want to, because the results on display here can't be matched to the time with him I traded to produce them, and it feels as though dedicating this work to him would be measuring his life up against the theorems contained here-in. I knew very well this work wasn't so important; these theorems, while fundamental, are just something people might cite to feel better about whatever sketchy sparse coding analysis they were already going to do, anyway. And yet, despite total freedom offered by the Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, I worried the brain was so dauntingly complex that I should feel lucky to have at last been offered a well-defined relevant problem to work on, particularly one I felt even remotely equipped to solve myself, so as to feel deserving of a Ph.D. from UC Berkeley. The fact is that whatever the eventual effect of this work on the scientific ecosystem, these truths could have waited, arrived at their own pace, via myself or another, and I could have been more present with my dad as he waited for death. I couldn't really fathom what it actually meant for him to die, to never see or talk to or hug him again, while the idea of putting original work out there, of crafting my own piece of the overwhelming puzzle that is neuroscience, was tantalizing. Let's say, then, that this dedication is the first bit of a life's work, real work void of any prestigious position or degree and the associated self-doubt and pressure, put toward passionate id	eas, solving problems I care about and that actually matter, loving and caring for others or, as my dad would say, ``being a mensch". May this dedication serve to hold myself publicly accountable to that. Also I love you, mom. I dedicate and don't dedicate this and everything to come to you, too.

%Why do neuroscientists care about dictionary learning?

Sparse coding is a common modern signal processing technique that views each of $N$ observed $n$-dimensional signal samples as a (noisy) linear combination of at most $k$ elementary waveforms drawn from some unknown ``dictionary" of size $m \ll N$ (see \cite{Zhang15} for a comprehensive review). 
%\IEEEPARstart{A}{}common modern approach to pattern analysis in signal processing is to view each of $N$ observed $n$-dimensional signal samples as a (noisy) linear combination of at most $k$ elementary waveforms drawn from some unknown ``dictionary" of size $m \ll N$ (see \cite{Zhang15} for a comprehensive review). 
Optimizing dictionaries subject to this and related sparsity constraints has revealed seemingly characteristic sparse structure in several signal classes of current interest (e.g., in vision \cite{wang2015sparse}). 

Of particular note are the seminal works in the field \cite{Olshausen96, hurri1996image, bell1997independent, van1998independent}, which discovered that dictionaries optimized for coding small patches of ``natural" images share qualitative similarities with linear filters estimated from response properties of simple-cell neurons in mammalian visual cortex. Curiously, these waveforms (e.g., ``Gabor'' wavelets) appear in dictionaries learned by a variety of algorithms trained over different natural image datasets, suggesting that learned features in natural signals may, in some sense, be canonical \cite{donoho2001can}.

Motivated by these discoveries and more recent work relating compressed sensing \cite{eldar2012compressed} to a theory of information transmission through random wiring bottlenecks in the brain \cite{Isely10}, we address when dictionaries for sparse representation are indeed identifiable from data. Answers to this question may also have implications in practice wherever an appeal is made to latent sparse structure of data (e.g., forgery detection \cite{hughes2010, olshausen2010applied}; brain recordings \cite{jung2001imaging, agarwal2014spatially, lee2016sparse}; and gene expression \cite{wu2016stability}). 

While several algorithms have been recently proposed to provably recover unique dictionaries under specific conditions (see \cite[Sec.~I-E]{Sun16} for a summary of the state-of-the-art), few theorems can be invoked to justify the consistency of inference under this model of data more broadly. To our knowledge, a universal guarantee of the uniqueness and stability of learned dictionaries and the sparse representations they induce over noisy data has yet to appear in the literature.

Here, we prove very generally that uniqueness and stability is a typical property of sparse dictionary learning. More specifically, we show that matrices injective on a sparse domain are identifiable from \mbox{$N = m(k-1){m \choose k} + m$} noisy linear combinations of $k$ of their $m$ columns up to an error that is linear in the noise (Thm.~\ref{DeterministicUniquenessTheorem}). In fact, provided $n \geq \min(2k,m)$, in almost all cases the problem is well-posed, as per Hadamard \cite{Hadamard1902}, given a sufficient amount of data (Thm.~\ref{robustPolythm} and Cor.~\ref{ProbabilisticCor}). 

Our guarantees also hold for a related (and perhaps more commonly posed, e.g. \cite{rehnsommer2007}) optimization problem seeking a dictionary minimizing the average number of elementary waveforms required to reconstruct each sample of the dataset (Thm.~\ref{SLCopt}). To practical benefit, our results impose no restrictions on learned dictionaries (e.g., that they, too, be injective over some sparse domain) beyond an upper bound on dictionary size, which is necessary in any case to avoid trivial solutions (e.g., allowing $m = N$). %That is, every pair of solutions of comparable size has some number of dictionary elements in common (up to noise), and similarly so for the coefficients of sparse codes they induce.

More precisely, let $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb R^{n \times m}$ be a matrix with columns $\mathbf{A}_j$ ($j = 1,\ldots,m$) and let dataset $Z$ consist of measurements:
\begin{align}\label{LinearModel}
\mathbf{z}_i = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_i + \mathbf{n}_i,\ \ \  \text{$i=1,\ldots,N$},
\end{align}
for $k$-\emph{sparse} $\mathbf{x}_i \in \mathbb{R}^m$ having at most $k<m$ nonzero entries and \emph{noise} $\mathbf{n}_i \in \mathbb{R}^n$, with bounded norm $\| \mathbf{n}_i \|_2 \leq  \eta$ representing our worst-case uncertainty in measuring the product $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_i$. We first consider the following formulation of sparse coding.
%The first mathematical problem we consider is the following.

\begin{problem}\label{InverseProblem}
Find a dictionary matrix $\mathbf{B}$ and $k$-sparse codes $\mathbf{\overline x}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{\overline x}_N$ that satisfy $\|\mathbf{z}_i - \mathbf{B}\mathbf{\overline x}_i\|_2 \leq \eta$ for all $i = 1,\ldots,N$.
\end{problem}

Note that every solution to Prob.~\ref{InverseProblem} represents infinitely many equivalent alternatives $\mathbf{BPD}$ and $\mathbf{D}^{-1}\mathbf{P}^{\top}\mathbf{\overline x}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{D}^{-1}\mathbf{P}^{\top}\mathbf{\overline x}_N$ parametrized by a choice of permutation matrix $\mathbf{P}$ and invertible diagonal matrix $\mathbf{D}$. 
Identifying these ambiguities (labelling and scale) yields a single orbit of solutions represented by any particular set of elementary waveforms (the columns of $\mathbf{B}$) and their associated sparse coefficients (the entries of $\mathbf{\overline x}_i$) that reconstruct each data point $\mathbf{z}_i$. 

Previous theoretical work addressing the noiseless case $\eta =0$ (e.g., \cite{li2004analysis, Georgiev05, Aharon06, Hillar15}) for matrices $\mathbf{B}$ having exactly $m$ columns has shown that a solution to Prob.~\ref{InverseProblem}, when it exists, is unique up to such relabeling and rescaling provided the $\mathbf{x}_i$ are sufficiently diverse and $\mathbf{A}$ satisfies the \textit{spark condition}:
\begin{align}\label{SparkCondition}
\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_1 = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_2 \implies \mathbf{x}_1 = \mathbf{x}_2, \ \ \ \text{for all $k$-sparse } \mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2,
\end{align}
%
which is necessary to guarantee the uniqueness of arbitrary $k$-sparse $\mathbf{x}_i$. We generalize these results to the practical setting  $\eta > 0$ by considering the following natural notion of stability with respect to measurement error.


\begin{definition}\label{maindef}
Fix $Y = \{ \mathbf{y}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{y}_N\} \subset \mathbb{R}^n$. We say $Y$ has a \textbf{$k$-sparse representation in $\mathbb{R}^m$} if there exists a matrix $\mathbf{A}$ and $k$-sparse $\mathbf{x}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_N \in \mathbb{R}^m$ such that $\mathbf{y}_i = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_i$ for all $i$. 
This representation is \textbf{stable} if for every $\delta_1, \delta_2 \geq 0$, there exists some $\varepsilon = \varepsilon(\delta_1, \delta_2)$ that is strictly positive for positive $\delta_1$ and $\delta_2$ such that if $\mathbf{B}$ and $k$-sparse $\mathbf{\overline x}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{\overline x}_N \in \mathbb{R}^m$ satisfy:
\begin{align*}
	\|\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{B}\mathbf{\overline x}_i\|_2 \leq \varepsilon(\delta_1, \delta_2),\ \   \text{for all $i=1,\ldots,N$},
\end{align*}
then there is some permutation matrix $\mathbf{P}$ and invertible diagonal matrix $\mathbf{D}$ such that for all $i, j$:
\begin{align}\label{def1}
\|\mathbf{A}_j - (\mathbf{BPD})_j\|_2 \leq \delta_1 \ \text{and} \ \|\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{D}^{-1}\mathbf{P}^{\top}\mathbf{\overline x}_i\|_1 \leq \delta_2.
\end{align}
\end{definition}

To see how Prob. \ref{InverseProblem} motivates Def. \ref{maindef}, suppose that $Y$ has a stable $k$-sparse representation in $\mathbb{R}^m$ and fix $\delta_1, \delta_2$ to be the desired accuracies of recovery in \eqref{def1}. Consider any dataset $Z$ generated as in \eqref{LinearModel} with $\eta \leq \frac{1}{2} \varepsilon(\delta_1, \delta_2)$. Using the triangle inequality, it follows that any $n \times m$ matrix $\mathbf{B}$ and $k$-sparse $\mathbf{\overline x}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{\overline x}_N$ solving Prob.~\ref{InverseProblem} are necessarily within $\delta_1$ and $\delta_2$ of the original dictionary $\mathbf{A}$ and codes $\mathbf{x}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_N$, respectively.\footnote{We mention that the different norms in \eqref{def1} reflect the distinct meanings typically ascribed to the dictionary and sparse codes in modeling data.}

The main result of this work is a very general uniqueness theorem for sparse coding (Thm.~\ref{DeterministicUniquenessTheorem}) directly 
implying (Cor.~\ref{DeterministicUniquenessCorollary}), which guarantees that sparse representations of a dataset $Z$ are unique up to noise whenever generating dictionaries $\mathbf{A}$ satisfy a spark condition on supports and the original sparse codes $\mathbf{x}_i$ are sufficiently diverse (e.g., Fig.~\ref{noisyrecovery}).  Moreover, we provide an explicit, computable $\varepsilon(\delta_1, \delta_2)$ in (\ref{epsdel}) that is linear in desired accuracy $\delta_1$, and essentially so in $\delta_2$.

In the next section, we give formal statements of these findings.  We then extend the same guarantees (Thm.~\ref{SLCopt}) to the following alternate formulation of dictionary learning, which minimizes the total number of nonzero entries in sparse codes.

\begin{problem}\label{OptimizationProblem}
Find matrices $\mathbf{B}$ and vectors \mbox{$\mathbf{\overline x}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{\overline x}_N$} solving:
\begin{align}\label{minsum}
\min \sum_{i = 1}^N \|\mathbf{\overline x}_{i}\|_0 \ \
\text{subject to} \ \ \|\mathbf{z}_i - \mathbf{B}\mathbf{\overline x}_i\|_2 \leq \eta, \ \text{for all $i$}.
\end{align}
\end{problem}

Our development of Thm.~\ref{DeterministicUniquenessTheorem} is general enough to provide some uniqueness and stability even when generating $\mathbf{A}$ do not fully satisfy (\ref{SparkCondition}) and recovery dictionaries $\mathbf{B}$ have more columns than $\mathbf{A}$.  Moreover, the approach incorporates a combinatorial theory for designing generating codes that should be of independent interest. We also give brief arguments adapting our results to dictionaries and codes drawn from probability distributions (Cor.~\ref{ProbabilisticCor}). The technical proofs of Thms.~\ref{DeterministicUniquenessTheorem} and ~\ref{SLCopt} are deferred to Sec.~\ref{DUT}, following some necessary definitions and a fact in combinatorial matrix analysis (Lem.~\ref{MainLemma}; proven in the Appendix). We discuss these results and their applications in depth in Sec.~\ref{Discussion} and outline open questions and future research directions in Sec.~\ref{FutureDirections}. 
%The Appendix contains a proof of Lem.~\ref{MainLemma}.

%\chapter{Results}
\section{Results}\label{Results}

%Denote by $\mathbf{x}^J$ the subvector formed from the entries of $\mathbf{x}$ indexed by $J$. 
%A set of $k$-sparse vectors is said to be in \emph{general linear position} when any $k$ of them are linearly independent. 

Precise statements of our results require that we first identify some combinatorial criteria on the supports\footnote{Recall that a vector $\mathbf{x}$ is said to be \emph{supported} in $S$ when $\mathbf{x} \in \text{\rmfamily span}\{\mathbf{e}_j: j\in S\}$, with $\mathbf{e}_j$ forming the standard column basis.} of sparse vectors. Let $\{1, \ldots, m\}$ be denoted $[m]$, its power set $2^{[m]}$, and ${[m] \choose k}$ the set of subsets of $[m]$ of size $k$.  A \emph{hypergraph} on vertices $[m]$  is simply any subset $\mathcal{H} \subseteq 2^{[m]}$. We say that $\mathcal{H}$ is \textit{$k$-uniform} when $\mathcal{H} \subseteq {[m] \choose k}$. The \emph{degree} $\deg_\mathcal{H}(i)$ of a node $i \in [m]$ is the number of sets in $\mathcal{H}$ that contain $i$, and we say $\mathcal{H}$ is \emph{regular} when for some $r$ we have $\deg_\mathcal{H}(i) = r$ for all $i$ (given such an $r$, we say $\mathcal{H}$ is \textit{$r$-regular}). We also write $2\mathcal{H} := \{ S \cup S': S, S' \in \mathcal{H}\}$.  The following class of structured hypergraphs is a key ingredient in this work.

\begin{definition}\label{sip}
Given $\mathcal{H} \subseteq 2^{[m]}$, the \textbf{star} $\sigma(i)$ is the collection of sets in $\mathcal{H}$ containing $i$. We say $\mathcal{H}$ has the \textbf{singleton intersection property} (\textbf{SIP}) when $\cap \sigma(i) = \{i\}$ for all $i \in [m]$. 
\end{definition}

We next give a quantitative generalization of the spark condition (\ref{SparkCondition}) to combinatorial subsets of supports. The \emph{lower bound} of an $n \times m$ matrix $\mathbf{M}$ is the largest $\alpha$ with \mbox{$\|\mathbf{M}\mathbf{x}\|_2 \geq \alpha\|\mathbf{x}\|_2$} for all $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^m$ \cite{Grcar10}. By compactness of the unit sphere, every injective linear map has a positive lower bound; hence, if $\mathbf{M}$ satisfies \eqref{SparkCondition}, then submatrices formed from $2k$ of its columns or less have strictly positive lower bounds. 

The lower bound of a matrix is generalized below in (\ref{Ldef}) by restricting it to the spans of certain submatrices\footnote{See \cite{vidal2005generalized} for an overview of the related ``union of subspaces" model.} associated with a hypergraph $\mathcal{H} \subseteq {[m] \choose k}$ of column indices. Let $\mathbf{M}_S$ denote the submatrix formed by the columns of a matrix $\mathbf{M}$ indexed by $S \subseteq [m]$ (setting $\mathbf{M}_\emptyset := \mathbf{0}$).  In the sections that follow, we shall also let $\bm{\mathcal{M}}_S$ denote the column-span of a submatrix $\mathbf{M}_S$, and $\bm{\mathcal{M}}_\mathcal{G}$ to denote $\{\bm{\mathcal{M}}_S\}_{S \in \mathcal{G}}$.  We define:  % Define $L_\mathcal{H}(\mathbf{M})$ as follows:
%\begin{align*} 
%L_\mathcal{H}(\mathbf{M}) := \min \left\{ \frac{ \|\mathbf{M}(\mathbf{x}_1-\mathbf{x}_2)\|_2 }{ \sqrt{2k} \|\mathbf{x}_1-\mathbf{x}_2\|_2} : \mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2 \in \cup_{S \in \mathcal{H}} \bm{\mathcal{M}}_S \right\},
%\end{align*} 
%
%where we write $L_{2k}$ in place of $L_\mathcal{H}$ when $\mathcal{H} = {[m] \choose k}$. Note that if $\mathcal{H}$ covers $[m]$, then $L_2 > L_\mathcal{H}$.\footnote{The reader should beware that $L_2 = L_{[m]}$, whereas $L = L_{\{[m]\}}$. For even $k$, the quantity $1 - \sqrt{k} L_k(\mathbf{M})$ is also known in the compressed sensing literature as the (asymmetric) lower restricted isometry constant \cite{Blanchard2011}.} Clearly, for any $\mathbf{M}$ satisfying \eqref{SparkCondition}, we have $L_{k'}(\mathbf{M}) > 0$ for  $k' \leq 2k$.
%\begin{align*}
%L_\mathcal{H}(\mathbf{M}) := \min \left\{ \frac{ \|\mathbf{M}_S\mathbf{x}\|_2 }{ \sqrt{k} \|\mathbf{x}\|_2} : S \in \mathcal{H} \right\},
%\end{align*} 
%\begin{align*}
%L_\mathcal{H}(\mathbf{M}) := \max \left\{ \ falpha: \|\mathbf{M}_S\mathbf{x}\|_2 \geq \alpha \sqrt{k} \|\mathbf{x}\|_2 : S \in \mathcal{H}, \ \ \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^m \right\},
%\end{align*} 
\begin{align}\label{Ldef}
L_\mathcal{H}(\mathbf{M}) := \min \left\{ \frac{\|\mathbf{M}_S\mathbf{x}\|_2}{ \sqrt{k} \|\mathbf{x}\|_2} : S \in \mathcal{H}, \ \mathbf{0} \neq \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{|S|} \right\},
\end{align} 
%
writing also $L_{k}$ in place of $L_\mathcal{H}$ when $\mathcal{H} = {[m] \choose k}$.\footnote{In compressed sensing literature, \mbox{$1 - \sqrt{k} L_k(\mathbf{M})$}  is the asymmetric lower restricted isometry constant for $\mathbf{M}$ with unit $\ell_2$-norm columns \cite{Blanchard2011}.\label{ripfootnote}}  As explained above, compactness implies that $L_{2k}(\mathbf{M}) > 0$ for all $\mathbf{M}$ satisfying \eqref{SparkCondition}. Clearly, $L_{\mathcal{H}'}(\mathbf{M}) \geq L_\mathcal{H}(\mathbf{M})$ whenever $\mathcal{H}' \subseteq \mathcal{H}$, and similarly any $k$-uniform $\mathcal{H}$ satisfying $\cup \mathcal{H} = [m]$ has $L_2 \geq L_{2\mathcal{H}} \geq L_{2k}$ (letting $L_{2k}$ := $L_m$ whenever $2k > m$).

We are now in a position to state our main result, though for expository purposes we leave the quantity $C_1$ %(a function of $\mathbf{A}$, $\mathbf{x}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_N$, and $\mathcal{H}$) 
undefined until Sec.~\ref{DUT}. All results  below assume real matrices and vectors. 

%eps-tightness COUNTER-EXAMPLE:
%Consider the alternate dictionary $B = \left(\mathbf{0}, \frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{e}_1 + \mathbf{e}_2), \mathbf{e}_3, \ldots, \mathbf{e}_{m} \right)$ and sparse codes $\mathbf{b}_i = \mathbf{e}_2$ for $i = 1, 2$ and $\mathbf{b}_i = \mathbf{e}_i$ for $i = 3, \ldots, m$. Then $|A\mathbf{a}_i - B\mathbf{b}_i| = 1/\sqrt{2}$ for $i = 1, 2$ (and $0$ otherwise). If there were permutation and invertible diagonal matrices $P \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times m}$ and $D \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times m}$ such that $|(A-BPD)\mathbf{e}_i| \leq C\varepsilon$ for all $i \in [m]$, then we would reach the contradiction $1 = |P^{-1}\mathbf{e}_1|_2 = |(A-BPD)P^{-1}\mathbf{e}_1|_2 \leq 1/\sqrt{2}$. 

\begin{theorem}\label{DeterministicUniquenessTheorem}
%Fix integers $n, k, m$ and $\overline m$. 
If an $n \times m$ matrix $\mathbf{A}$ satisfies $L_{2\mathcal{H}}(\mathbf{A}) > 0$ for some $r$-regular $\mathcal{H} \subseteq {[m] \choose k}$ with the SIP, and $k$-sparse \mbox{$\mathbf{x}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_N \in \mathbb{R}^m$} include more than $(k-1){\overline m \choose k}$ vectors in general linear position\footnote{Recall that a set of vectors sharing support $S$ are in \emph{general linear position} when any $|S|$ of them are linearly independent.} supported in each $S \in \mathcal{H}$, then the following recovery guarantees hold for $C_1 > 0$ given by \eqref{Cdef1}.

\textbf{Dictionary Recovery:} Fix $\varepsilon < L_{2}(\mathbf{A}) / C_1$.\footnote{Note that the condition $\varepsilon < L_2(\mathbf{A}) /C_1$ is necessary; otherwise, with \mbox{$\mathbf{A}$ = $\mathbf{I}$} (the identity matrix) and $\mathbf{x}_i = \mathbf{e}_i$, the matrix $\mathbf{B} = \left[\mathbf{0}, \frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{e}_1 + \mathbf{e}_2), \mathbf{e}_3, \ldots, \mathbf{e}_{m} \right]$ and sparse codes $\mathbf{\overline x}_i = \mathbf{e}_2$ for $i = 1, 2$ and $\mathbf{\overline x}_i = \mathbf{e}_i$ for $i \geq 3$ satisfy $\|\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{B}\mathbf{\overline x}_i \|_2 \leq \varepsilon$ but nonetheless violate \eqref{Cstable}.} If an $n \times \overline m$ matrix $\mathbf{B}$ has, for every $i \in [N]$, an associated $k$-sparse $\mathbf{\overline x}_i$ satisfying \mbox{$\|\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{B}\mathbf{\overline x}_i\|_2 \leq \varepsilon$}, then $\overline m \geq m$, and provided that $\overline m (r-1) < mr$, there is a permutation matrix $\mathbf{P}$ and an invertible diagonal matrix $\mathbf{D}$ such that:
\begin{align}\label{Cstable}
\|\mathbf{A}_j- (\mathbf{BPD})_j\|_2 \leq C_1 \varepsilon, \ \ \text{for all } j \in J,
\end{align}
%
for some $J \subseteq [m]$ of size \mbox{$m - (r-1)(\overline m - m)$}. 
% $\overline m - r(\overline m - m)$

\textbf{Code Recovery:} If, moreover, $\mathbf{A}_J$ satisfies \eqref{SparkCondition} and $\varepsilon < L_{2k}(\mathbf{A}_J) / C_1$, then $(\mathbf{BP})_J$ also satisfies \eqref{SparkCondition} with $L_{2k}(\mathbf{BP}_J) \geq (L_{2k}(\mathbf{A}_J) - C_1 \varepsilon) / \|\mathbf{D}_J\|_1$, and for all $i \in [N]$:
\begin{align}\label{b-PDa}
%\|\mathbf{x}^J_i - \mathbf{D}^{-1}\mathbf{P}^{\top}\mathbf{\overline x}^{\overline J}_i\|_1 &\leq  \left( \frac{ 1+C_1 \|\mathbf{x}^{J}_i\|_1 }{ L_{2k}(\mathbf{A}) -  C_1\varepsilon } \right) \varepsilon \ \  \text{for $i \in [N]$}.
\|(\mathbf{x}_i)_J - (\mathbf{D}^{-1}\mathbf{P}^{\top} \mathbf{\overline x}_i)_J\|_1 &\leq  \left( \frac{ 1+C_1 \|(\mathbf{x}_i)_J\|_1 }{ L_{2k}(\mathbf{A}_J) -  C_1\varepsilon } \right) \varepsilon,
\end{align}
%
where subscript $(\cdot)_J$ here represents the subvector formed from restricting to coordinates indexed by $J$.
\end{theorem}

%We delay defining the explicit constant $C_1$ until Section \ref{DUT} (\eqref{Cdef1}).
%To be clear, the implication of Thm.~\ref{DeterministicUniquenessTheorem} is that $Y = \{\mathbf{Ax}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{Ax}_N\}$ has a stable $k$-sparse representation in $\mathbb{R}^m$, with \eqref{def1} guaranteed provided $\varepsilon$ in Def.~\ref{maindef} does not exceed: 
In words, Thm.~\ref{DeterministicUniquenessTheorem} says that the smaller the regularity $r$ of the original support hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ or the difference $\overline m - m$ between the assumed and actual number of elements in the latent dictionary, the more columns and coefficients of the original dictionary $\mathbf{A}$ and sparse codes $\mathbf{x}_i$ are guaranteed to be contained (up to noise) in the appropriately labelled and scaled recovered dictionary $\mathbf{B}$ and codes $\mathbf{\overline x}_i$, respectively. 

In the important special case when $\overline m = m$, the theorem directly implies that  $Y = \{\mathbf{Ax}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{Ax}_N\}$ has a stable $k$-sparse representation in $\mathbb{R}^m$, with inequalities \eqref{def1} guaranteed in Def.~\ref{maindef} for the following worst-case error $\varepsilon$: 
\begin{align}\label{epsdel}

\end{align}

Since sparse codes in general linear position are straightforward to produce with a ``Vandermonde''  construction (i.e., by choosing columns of the matrix $[\gamma_{i}^j]_{i,j=1}^{k,N}$, for distinct nonzero $\gamma_i$), we have the following direct consequence of Thm.~\ref{DeterministicUniquenessTheorem}.

\begin{corollary}\label{DeterministicUniquenessCorollary}
Given any regular hypergraph $\mathcal{H} \subseteq {[m] \choose k}$ with the SIP, there are $N =  |\mathcal{H}| \left[ (k-1){m \choose k} + 1  \right]$ vectors \mbox{$\mathbf{x}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_N \in \mathbb{R}^m$} such that every matrix $\mathbf{A}$ satisfying spark condition \eqref{SparkCondition} generates $Y = \{\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_N\}$ with a stable $k$-sparse representation in $\mathbb{R}^m$ for $\varepsilon(\delta_1,\delta_2)$ given by \eqref{epsdel}.

%We claim that the assumptions of Thm.~\ref{DeterministicUniquenessTheorem} are easily met with deterministic constructions.

%An immediate practical implication of this result is that there exists a practical procedure to affirm if one's proposed solution $(\mathbf{B}, \mathbf{\overline x}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_N)$ to Prob.~\ref{InverseProblem} is indeed unique (up to noise and inherent ambiguities): simply check that $\mathbf{B}$ and the $\mathbf{\overline x}_i$ satisfy the assumptions on $\mathbf{A}$ and the $\mathbf{x}_i$ in Thm.~\ref{DeterministicUniquenessTheorem}.

%%In fact, a more general result (stated clearly in the next section) can be gleaned from our method of proving Thm.~\ref{DeterministicUniquenessTheorem}. Briefly, in cases where $\mathbf{B}$ has $\overline m \neq m$ columns, or $\mathcal{H}$ is not regular or only partially satisfying the SIP, a relation between $\overline m$ and the degree sequence of nodes in $\mathcal{H}$ gives indices $J \subseteq [m]$ defining a submatrix $\mathbf{A}_J$ and subvectors $\mathbf{x}_i^J$ that are recoverable in the sense of \eqref{Cstable} and \eqref{b-PDa}. For example, if $\mathcal{H}$ is $\ell$-regular with the SIP but $m \leq \overline m < m\ell/(\ell - 1)$ then we have nonzero $|J| = \overline m - \ell(\overline m - m)$. The implication here is that the smaller the difference $\overline m - m$, the more columns and code entries of the original $n \times m$ dictionary $\mathbf{A}$ and codes $\mathbf{x}_i$ contained (up to noise) in the appropriately scaled $n \times \overline m$ dictionary $\mathbf{B}$ and codes $\mathbf{\overline x}_i$. When $\overline m = m$, we recover Thm.~\ref{DeterministicUniquenessTheorem}.

%We also have the following refinement of a result in \cite{Hillar15}:
%\begin{corollary}
%Those square matrices $\mathbf{A}$ that satisfy \mbox{$L_{2\mathcal{H}}(\mathbf{A}) > 0$} for some regular $k$-uniform hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ with the SIP and have the property that $\mathbf{Ax}$ is $k$-sparse for all $k$-sparse $\mathbf{x}$ with support in $\mathcal{H}$ are the matrices $\mathbf{PD}$, where $\mathbf{P}$ and $\mathbf{D}$ run over permutation and invertible diagonal matrices, respectively.
%\end{corollary}

One can easily verify that for every $k < m$ there are regular $k$-uniform hypergraphs $\mathcal{H}$ with the SIP besides the obvious $\mathcal{H} = {[m] \choose k}$. For instance, take $\mathcal{H}$ to be the $k$-regular set of consecutive intervals of length $k$ in some cyclic order on $[m]$. In this case, a direct consequence of Cor.~\ref{DeterministicUniquenessCorollary} is rigorous verification of the lower bound \mbox{$N = m(k-1){m \choose k} + m$} for sufficient sample size from the introduction. Special cases allow for even smaller hypergraphs. For example, if $k = \sqrt{m}$, then a 2-regular $k$-uniform hypergraph with the SIP can be constructed as the $2k$ rows and columns formed by arranging the elements of $[m]$ into a square grid.

%\cite{li2004analysis, Georgiev05, Aharon06, Hillar15}
We should stress here that framing the problem in terms of hypergraphs has allowed us to show, unlike in previous research on the subject, that the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ need not necessarily satisfy \eqref{SparkCondition} to be recoverable from data. As an example, let $\mathbf{A} = [ \mathbf{e}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{e}_5, \mathbf{v}]$ with $\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{e}_1 + \mathbf{e}_3 + \mathbf{e}_5$ and take $\mathcal{H}$ to be all consecutive pairs of indices $1, \ldots ,6$ arranged in cyclic order. Then for $k=2$, the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ fails to satisfy \eqref{SparkCondition} while still obeying the assumptions of Thm.~\ref{DeterministicUniquenessTheorem} for dictionary recovery.%, hence guaranteeing \eqref{Cstable} . %(since $\{ \mathbf{A}_1, \mathbf{A}_3, \mathbf{A}_5, \mathbf{A}_6\}$ is not a linearly independent set).
%This weakening allows for a practical (polynomial) amount of data to still guarantee a stable dictionary in the case where the set of sparse supports for the $\mathbf{\overline x}_i$ is known to have a size that grows polynomially in $m$ and $k$.

A practical implication of Thm.~\ref{DeterministicUniquenessTheorem} is the following: there is an effective procedure sufficient to affirm if a proposed solution to Prob.~\ref{InverseProblem} is indeed unique (up to noise and inherent ambiguities). One need simply check that the matrix and codes satisfy the (computable) assumptions of Thm.~\ref{DeterministicUniquenessTheorem} on $\mathbf{A}$ and the $\mathbf{x}_i$. In general, however, there is no known efficient procedure. We defer a brief discussion on this point to the next section.

Another extension of Thm.~\ref{DeterministicUniquenessTheorem} can be derived from the following algebraic characterization of the spark condition.  Letting $\mathbf{A}$ be the $n \times m$ matrix of $nm$ indeterminates $A_{ij}$, the reader may work out why substituting real numbers for the $A_{ij}$ yields a matrix satisfying \eqref{SparkCondition} if and only if the following polynomial evaluates to a nonzero number:
\begin{align*}
f(\mathbf{A}) := \prod_{S \in {[m] \choose 2k}} \sum_{S' \in {[n] \choose 2k}} (\det \mathbf{A}_{S',S})^2,
\end{align*}
%
where for any $S' \in {[n] \choose 2k}$ and $S \in {[m] \choose 2k}$, the symbol $\mathbf{A}_{S',S}$ denotes the submatrix of entries $A_{ij}$ with $(i,j) \in S' \times S$.\footnote{The large number of terms in this product is likely necessary given that deciding whether or not a matrix satisfies the spark condition is NP-hard \cite{tillmann2014computational}.}

Since $f$ is analytic, having a single substitution of a real matrix $\mathbf{A}$ satisfying $f(\mathbf{A}) \neq 0$ implies that the zeroes of $f$ form a set of (Borel) measure zero. Such a matrix is easily constructed by adding rows of zeroes to a $\min(2k,m) \times m$ Vandermonde matrix as mentioned previously, so that every sum in the product defining $f$ above is strictly positive. Thus, almost every $n \times m$ matrix with $n \geq \min(2k,m)$ satisfies \eqref{SparkCondition}.

%Another extension of Thm.~\ref{DeterministicUniquenessTheorem} arises from the following analytic characterization of the spark condition.  Let $\mathbf{A}$  be the $n \times m$ matrix of $nm$ indeterminates $A_{ij}$. When real numbers are substituted for $A_{ij}$, the resulting matrix satisfies \eqref{SparkCondition} if and only if the following polynomial is nonzero:
%\begin{align*}
%f(\mathbf{A}) := \prod_{S \in {[m] \choose k}} \sum_{S' \in {[n] \choose k}} (\det \mathbf{A}_{S',S})^2,
%\end{align*}
%
%where for any $S' \in {[n] \choose k}$ and $S \in {[m] \choose k}$, the symbol $\mathbf{A}_{S',S}$ denotes the submatrix of entries $A_{ij}$ with $(i,j) \in S' \times S$.   We note that the large number of terms in this product is likely necessary due to the NP-hardness of deciding whether a given matrix $\mathbf{A}$ satisfies the spark condition \cite{tillmann2014computational}.

%Since $f$ is analytic, having a single substitution of a real matrix $\mathbf{A}$ with $f(\mathbf{A}) \neq 0$ necessarily implies that the zeroes of $f$ form a set of measure zero. Fortunately, such a matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is easily constructed by adding rows of zeroes to any $\min(2k,m) \times m$ Vandermonde matrix as described above (so that each term in the product above for $f$ is nonzero). Hence, almost every $n \times m$ matrix with $n \geq \min(2k,m)$ satisfies \eqref{SparkCondition}.

We claim that a similar phenomenon applies to datasets of vectors with a stable sparse representation. Briefly, following the same procedure as in \cite[Sec.~IV]{Hillar15}, for $k < m$ and $n \geq \min(2k, m)$, we may consider the ``symbolic'' dataset $Y = \{\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{A} \mathbf{x}_N\}$ generated by an indeterminate $n \times m$ matrix $\mathbf{A}$ and $m$-dimensional $k$-sparse vectors $\mathbf{x}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_N$ indeterminate within their supports, which form a regular hypergraph $\mathcal{H} \subseteq {[m] \choose k}$ satisfying the SIP. Restricting \mbox{$(k-1){m \choose k} + 1$} indeterminate $\mathbf{x}_i$ to each support in $\mathcal{H}$, and letting $\textbf{M}$ be the $n \times N$ matrix with columns $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_i$, it can be checked that when $f(\mathbf{M}) \neq 0$ for a substitution of real numbers for the indeterminates, all of the assumptions on $\mathbf{A}$ and the $\mathbf{x}_i$ in Thm.~\ref{DeterministicUniquenessTheorem} are satisfied. We therefore have the following.  % ; in particular, $\mathbf{A}$ satisfies \eqref{SparkCondition}

\begin{theorem}\label{robustPolythm}
%Let $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{x}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_N$ be an indeterminate $n \times m$ matrix and sequence of $m$-dimensional vectors, respectively. 
There is a polynomial in the entries of $\mathbf{A}$ and the $\mathbf{x}_i$ that evaluates to a nonzero number only when $Y$ has a stable $k$-sparse representation in $\mathbb{R}^m$. In particular, almost all substitutions impart to $Y$ this property.
\end{theorem}

%To extend this observation to arbitrary probability distributions, note that if a set of measure spaces $\{(X_{\ell}, \nu_{\ell})\}_{\ell=1}^p$ has measures $\nu_{\ell}$ absolutely continuous with respect to the standard Borel measure on $\mathbb{R}$ for all $\ell \in [p]$, then the product measure $\prod_{\ell=1}^p \nu_{\ell}$ is also absolutely continuous with respect to the standard Borel product measure on $\mathbb{R}^p$ (e.g., see \cite{folland2013real}).  This fact combined with Thm.~\ref{robustPolythm} implies the following.
To extend this observation to arbitrary probability distributions, note that if a set of $p$ measure spaces has all measures absolutely continuous with respect to the standard Borel measure on $\mathbb{R}$, then the product measure is also absolutely continuous with respect to the standard Borel product measure on $\mathbb{R}^p$ (e.g., see \cite{folland2013real}).  This fact combined with Thm.~\ref{robustPolythm} implies the following.\footnote{We refer the reader to \cite{Hillar15} for a more detailed explanation of these arguments.}

\begin{corollary}\label{ProbabilisticCor}
If the indeterminate entries of $\mathbf{A}$ and the $\mathbf{x}_i$ are drawn independently from probability distributions absolutely continuous with respect to the standard Borel measure, then $Y$ has a stable $k$-sparse representation in $\mathbb{R}^m$ with probability one.
\end{corollary}

Thus, drawing the dictionary and supported sparse coefficients from any continuous probability distribution almost always generates data with a stable sparse representation.

We close this section with some comments on the optimality of our results.  The linear scaling for $\varepsilon$ in \eqref{epsdel} is essentially optimal (e.g., see \cite{arias2013fundamental}), but a basic open problem remains: how many samples are necessary to determine the sparse coding model? 
Our results demonstrate that sparse codes $\mathbf{x}_i$ drawn from only a polynomial number of $k$-dimensional subspaces permit stable identification of the generating dictionary $\mathbf{A}$. 
This lends some legitimacy to the use of the model in practice, where data in general are unlikely (if ever) to exhibit the exponentially many possible $k$-wise combinations of dictionary elements required by (to our knowledge) all previously published results. 

Consequently, if $k$ is held fixed or if the size of the support set of reconstructing codes is polynomial in $\overline m$ and $k$, then a practical (polynomial) amount of data suffices to identify the dictionary.\footnote{In the latter case, a reexamination of the pigeonholing argument in the proof of Thm.~\ref{DeterministicUniquenessTheorem} requires a polynomial number of samples distributed over a polynomial number of supports.} Reasons to be skeptical that this holds in general, however, can be found in \cite{tillmann2014computational, Tillmann15}. Even so, in the next section we discuss how probabilistic guarantees can in fact be made for any number of available samples.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% need to cut maybe: 
%As mentioned in the previous section, Thm.~\ref{DeterministicUniquenessTheorem} is a particular case of a more general result that forgoes the assumption that $\mathcal{H} \subseteq {[m] \choose k}$ is regular and satisfies the SIP. If instead we require only that the stars $\cap \sigma(i)$ intersect at singletons for all $i \leq q$ (assuming that the nodes of $\mathcal{H}$ are labeled in some order of non-increasing degree), we have that $\overline m \geq k|\mathcal{H}| / \deg(1)$ and, provided $\overline m < k|\mathcal{H}| / (\deg(1) - 1)$, the nonempty submatrix $J$ is of size equal to the largest number $p$ satisfying:
%\begin{align}\label{pcond}
%\sum_{i=\ell}^{m} \deg(i) > (\overline m + 1 - \ell) (\deg(\ell) - 1) \ \ \text{for all } \ell \leq p \leq q.
%\end{align}
%Specifically, $J$ contains all nodes of degree exceeding $\deg(p)$ and some subset of those with degreee equal to $\deg(p)$. For the benefit of the reader, we do not prove explicitly this more general result below; it can be discerned from how exactly Lemma \ref{NonEmptyLemma} is incorporated into the proof of Lem.~\ref{MainLemma}.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%As mentioned in the previous section, Thm.~\ref{DeterministicUniquenessTheorem} is a particular case of a more general result, which requires a looser set of constraints on the hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ and which applies to $n \times \overline m$ matrices $\mathbf{B}$ (and $\overline m$-dimensional codes $\mathbf{\overline x}_i$) with $\overline m \neq m$:

%Fix $\overline m$ and suppose the assumptions of Thm.~\ref{DeterministicUniquenessTheorem} hold, only now with the constraints on $\mathcal{H} \subseteq {[m] \choose k}$ being just that $|\cap H(i)| = 1$ for all $i \leq q$ (assuming w.l.o.g. that the nodes of $\mathcal{H}$ are labeled in some order of non-increasing degree), and with more than $(k-1){\overline m \choose k}$ vectors $\mathbf{x}_i$ supported in g.l.p. on each $S \in \mathcal{H}$. Then we must have $\overline m \geq k|\mathcal{H}| / \deg(1)$ and, provided $\overline m < k|\mathcal{H}| / (\deg(1) - 1)$, the guarantee \eqref{Cstable} holds for a submatrix $\mathbf{A}_J$, where $J \subseteq[m]$ is nonempty and of a size equal to the largest number $p$ satisfying:
%\begin{align}\label{pcond}
%\sum_{i=\ell}^{m} \deg(i) > (\overline m + 1 - \ell) (\deg(\ell) - 1) \ \ \text{for all } \ell \leq p \leq q.
%\end{align}
%Specifically, $J$ consists of the union of the set of all nodes of degree exceeding $\deg(p)$ and some subset of those nodes with degrees equal to $\deg(p)$. 

%For the benefit of the reader, we prove below the case where we forgo only the constraint that $\overline m = m$. This yields the implication $\overline m \geq m$ and \eqref{pcond} reduces to $|J| = \overline m - r(\overline m - m)$. The extension to the general result above can be seen by examining how exactly Lemma \ref{NonEmptyLemma} is incorporated into the overall proof. 

% ======== b - PDa =========

% WITH EXPLICIT J SUBSCRIPT
%We begin our proof of Thm.~\ref{DeterministicUniquenessTheorem} by showing how dictionary recovery \eqref{Cstable} already implies sparse code recovery \eqref{b-PDa} when $\mathbf{A}_J$ satisfies \eqref{SparkCondition} and \mbox{$\varepsilon < L_{2k}(\mathbf{A}_J) / C_1$}. %, assuming that $\overline m = m$ without loss of generality. 
%Consider any $2k$-sparse $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^m$ and note that $\|\mathbf{x}\|_1 \leq \sqrt{2k}  \|\mathbf{x}\|_2$. By definition of $L_{2k}$ in \eqref{Ldef}, we have:
%\begin{align}\label{stuff}
%\|\mathbf{x}_J - &( \mathbf{D}^{-1}\mathbf{P}^{\top}\mathbf{\overline x} )_J\|_1 \nonumber
%\leq \frac{\|(\mathbf{BPD})_J(\mathbf{x}_J - (\mathbf{D}^{-1}\mathbf{P}^{\top}\mathbf{\overline x})_J)\|_2}{L_{2k}((\mathbf{BPD})_J)} \\ \nonumber
%&\leq \frac{\|( (\mathbf{BPD})_J - \mathbf{A}_J) \mathbf{x}_J\|_2 + \|\mathbf{A}_J\mathbf{x}_J - \mathbf{B}_J\mathbf{\overline x}_J\|_2}{L_{2k}((\mathbf{BPD})_J)} \\
%&\leq \frac{C_1\varepsilon \|\mathbf{x}_J\|_1 + \varepsilon}{L_{2k}((\mathbf{BPD})_J)},
%\end{align}
%where the term $C_1\varepsilon \|\mathbf{x}_J\|_1$ in the numerator above is a consequence of the triangle inequality applied to \eqref{Cstable}.

%It remains for us to bound the denominator.  By the reverse triangle inequality:
%\begin{align*}
%\|(\mathbf{BPD})_J\mathbf{x}_J\|_2 
%&\geq | \|\mathbf{A}_J\mathbf{x}_J\|_2 - \|(\mathbf{A}_J - (\mathbf{BPD})_J)\mathbf{x}_J\|_2 | \\
%&\geq \sqrt{2k} (L_{2k}(\mathbf{A}_J) -  C_1\varepsilon) \|\mathbf{x}_J\|_2,
%\end{align*}
%
%wherein removal of the absolute value is justified since $C_1\varepsilon < L_{2k}(\mathbf{A}_J)$. We therefore have that $L_{2k}((\mathbf{BPD})_J) \geq L_{2k}(\mathbf{A}_J) - C_1\varepsilon  > 0$, and \eqref{b-PDa} then follows from \eqref{stuff}.


% WITHOUT J SUBSCRIPT
We begin our proof of Thm.~\ref{DeterministicUniquenessTheorem} by showing how dictionary recovery \eqref{Cstable} already implies sparse code recovery \eqref{b-PDa} when $\mathbf{A}$ satisfies \eqref{SparkCondition} and \mbox{$\varepsilon < L_{2k}(\mathbf{A}) / C_1$}. We temporarily assume (without loss of generality) that $\overline m = m$, so as to omit an otherwise requisite subscript $(\cdot)_J$ around certain matrices and vectors. By definition of $L_{2k}$ in \eqref{Ldef}, and noting that $\sqrt{k} \|\mathbf{v}\|_2 \geq \|\mathbf{v}\|_1$ for $k$-sparse $\mathbf{v}$, we have for all $i \in [N[$:
\begin{align}\label{stuff}
\|\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{D}^{-1}\mathbf{P}^{\top}\mathbf{\overline x}_i \|_1 \nonumber
&\leq \frac{\|\mathbf{BPD}(\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{D}^{-1}\mathbf{P}^{\top}\mathbf{\overline x}_i)\|_2}{L_{2k}(\mathbf{BPD})} \\ \nonumber
&\leq \frac{\|( \mathbf{BPD} - \mathbf{A}) \mathbf{x}_i\|_2 + \|\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{B}\mathbf{\overline x}_i\|_2}{L_{2k}(\mathbf{BPD})} \\
&\leq \frac{C_1\varepsilon \|\mathbf{x}_i\|_1 + \varepsilon}{L_{2k}(\mathbf{BPD})},
\end{align}
%\begin{align}\label{stuff}
%\frac{ \|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{D}^{-1}\mathbf{P}^{\top}\mathbf{\overline x} \|_1 } { \|\mathbf{D}^{-1}\|_1 }  \
%&\leq \|\mathbf{Dx} - \mathbf{P}^{\top}\mathbf{\overline x} \|_1 \\ \nonumber
%&\leq \frac{\|\mathbf{BP}(\mathbf{D}\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{P}^{\top}\mathbf{\overline x})\|_2}{L_{2k}(\mathbf{BP})} \\ \nonumber
%&\leq \frac{\|( \mathbf{BPD} - \mathbf{A}) \mathbf{x}\|_2 + \|\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{B}\mathbf{\overline x}\|_2}{L_{2k}(\mathbf{BP})} \\
%&\leq \frac{C_1\varepsilon \|\mathbf{x}\|_1 + \varepsilon}{L_{2k}(\mathbf{BP})},
%\end{align}
where the first term in the numerator above follows from the triangle inequality and \eqref{Cstable}.

It remains for us to bound the denominator. For any $2k$-sparse $\mathbf{x}$, we have by the triangle inequality:
\begin{align*}
\|\mathbf{BPD}\mathbf{x}\|_2 
&\geq \|\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}\|_2 - \|(\mathbf{A} - \mathbf{BPD})\mathbf{x}\|_2 \\
&\geq \sqrt{2k} (L_{2k}(\mathbf{A}) -  C_1\varepsilon) \|\mathbf{x}\|_2,
\end{align*}

%\begin{align*}
%\|\mathbf{BP}\mathbf{x}\|_2 
%&\geq \|\mathbf{A}\mathbf{D}^{-1}\mathbf{x}\|_2 - \|(\mathbf{A} - \mathbf{BPD})\mathbf{D}^{-1}\mathbf{x}\|_2 \\
%&\geq \sqrt{2k} (L_{2k}(\mathbf{A}) -  C_1\varepsilon) \|\mathbf{D}^{-1}\mathbf{x}\|_2, \\ 
%&\geq \sqrt{2k} (L_{2k}(\mathbf{A}) -  C_1\varepsilon) \|\mathbf{D}^{-1}\|_{?} \| \mathbf{x}\|_2,
%\end{align*}
%
We therefore have that $L_{2k}(\mathbf{BPD}) \geq L_{2k}(\mathbf{A}) - C_1\varepsilon  > 0$, and \eqref{b-PDa} then follows from \eqref{stuff}. The reader may also verify that $L_{2k}(\mathbf{BP}) \geq L_{2k}(\mathbf{BPD}) / \|\mathbf{D}\|_1$.

The heart of the matter is therefore \eqref{Cstable}, which we now establish beginning with the important special case of $k = 1$. 

\begin{proof}[Proof of Thm.~\ref{DeterministicUniquenessCorollary} for $k=1$]
Since the only 1-uniform hypergraph with the SIP is $[m]$, which is obviously regular, we require only $\mathbf{x}_i = c_i \mathbf{e}_i$ for $i \in [m]$, with $c_i \neq 0$ to guarantee  linear independence. While we have yet to define $C_1$ generally, in this case we may set $C_1 = 1/ \min_{\ell \in [m]} |c_{\ell}|$ so that $\varepsilon < L_2(\mathbf{A})  \min_{\ell \in [m]} |c_{\ell}|$. 

Fix $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}$ satisfying $L_2(\mathbf{A}) > 0$, since here we have $2\mathcal{H} = {[m] \choose 2}$, and suppose some $\mathbf{B}$ and $1$-sparse $\mathbf{\overline x}_i \in \mathbb{R}^{\overline m}$ have  $\|\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{B}\mathbf{\overline x}_i\|_2 \leq \varepsilon < L_2(\mathbf{A}) / C_1$ for all $i$. Then, there exist $\overline{c}_1, \ldots, \overline{c}_m \in \mathbb{R}$ and a map $\pi: [m] \to [\overline m]$ such that:
\begin{align}\label{1D}
\|c_i\mathbf{A}_i - \overline{c}_i\mathbf{B}_{\pi(i)}\|_2 \leq \varepsilon,\ \ \text{for $i \in [m]$}.
\end{align} 
Note that $\overline{c}_i \neq 0$, since otherwise we would reach the following contradiction: $\|\mathbf{A}_i \|_2 \leq C_1 |c_i| \|\mathbf{A}_i \|_2  \leq C_1\varepsilon < L_2(\mathbf{A}) \leq L_1(\mathbf{A}) = \min_{i \in [m]} \|\mathbf{A}_{i}\|_2$. %implies by \eqref{delrho} the contradiction $|c_i| < \min_{\ell \in [m]} | c_\ell |$.

We now show that $\pi$ is injective (in particular, a permutation if $\overline m = m$). Suppose that $\pi(i) = \pi(j) = \ell$ for some $i \neq j$ and $\ell$. Then, $\|c_{i}\mathbf{A}_{i} - \overline{c}_{i} \mathbf{B}_{\ell}\|_2  \leq \varepsilon$ and $\|c_{j}\mathbf{A}_{j} - \overline{c}_{j}\mathbf{B}_{\ell}\|_2 \leq \varepsilon$, and we have: %Scaling and summing these inequalities by $|\overline{c}_{i}|$ and $|\overline{c}_{j}|$, respectively, and applying the triangle inequality to annihilate the terms in $\mathbf{B}_\ell$, we obtain:
\begin{align*}
(|\overline{c}_{i}| + |\overline{c}_{j}|) \varepsilon
&\geq |\overline{c}_{i}| \|c_{j}\mathbf{A}_{j} - \overline{c}_{j}\mathbf{B}_{\ell}\|_2  + |\overline{c}_{j}| \|c_{i}\mathbf{A}_{i} - \overline{c}_{i} \mathbf{B}_{\ell}\|_2 \nonumber \\
&\geq \|\mathbf{A}(\overline{c}_{i}c_{j} \mathbf{e}_{j} - \overline{c}_{j}c_{i}\mathbf{e}_{i})\|_2 \nonumber \\ 
&\geq \sqrt{2}  L_2(\mathbf{A}) \|\overline{c}_{i}c_{j} \mathbf{e}_{j} - \overline{c}_{j}c_{i}\mathbf{e}_{i}\|_2 \nonumber \\
&\geq  L_2(\mathbf{A}) \left( |\overline{c}_{i}| + |\overline{c}_{j}| \right) \min_{\ell \in [m]} |c_\ell |,
\end{align*}
contradicting our assumed upper bound on $\varepsilon$. Hence, the map $\pi$ is injective and so $\overline m \geq m$. %Setting $\overline J = \pi([m])$ and 

Letting $\mathbf{P}$ and $\mathbf{D}$ be the $\overline m \times \overline m$ permutation and invertible diagonal matrices with, respectively, columns $\mathbf{e}_{\pi(i)}$ and $\frac{\overline{c}_i}{c_i}\mathbf{e}_i$ for $i \in [m]$ (otherwise, $\mathbf{e}_{i}$ for $i \in [\overline{m}] \setminus [m]$), we may rewrite \eqref{1D} to see that for all $i \in [m]$:
\begin{align*}
\|\mathbf{A}_i - (\mathbf{BPD})_i\|_2 
= \|\mathbf{A}_i - \frac{\overline{c}_i}{c_i}\mathbf{B}_{\pi(i)}\|_2 
\leq \frac{\varepsilon}{|c_i|} 
\leq C_1\varepsilon.
\end{align*}

\end{proof}

An extension of the proof to the general case $k < m$ requires some additional tools to derive the general expression \eqref{Cdef1} for $C_1$. These include a generalized notion of distance (Def.~\ref{dDef}) and angle (Def.~\ref{FriedrichsDefinition}) between subspaces as well as a stability result in combinatorial matrix analysis (Lem.~\ref{MainLemma}). 

\begin{definition}\label{dDef}
For $\mathbf{u} \in \mathbb R^m$ and vector spaces $U,V \subseteq \mathbb{R}^m$, let $\text{\rmfamily dist}(\mathbf{u}, V) := \min \{\| \mathbf{u}-\mathbf{v} \|_2: \mathbf{v} \in V\}$ and define:
\begin{align}
d(U,V) := \max_{\mathbf{u} \in U, \ \|\mathbf{u}\|_2 \leq 1} \text{\rmfamily dist}(\mathbf{u},V).
\end{align}
\end{definition}

We note the following facts about $d$. Clearly, 
\begin{align}\label{UsubU}
U' \subseteq U \implies d(U',V) \leq d(U,V).
\end{align}
From \cite[Ch.~4 Cor.~2.6]{Kato2013}, we also have: %Kato p.223
\begin{align}\label{dimLem}
d(U,V) < 1 \implies \dim(U) \leq \dim(V),
\end{align}
and from \cite[Lem.~3.2]{Morris10}:
\begin{align}\label{eqdim}
\dim(U) = \dim(V) \implies d(U,V) = d(V,U).
\end{align}

The following is our result in combinatorial matrix analysis; it contains most of the complexity in the proof of Thm.~\ref{DeterministicUniquenessTheorem}. 

\begin{lemma}\label{MainLemma}
If an $n \times m$ matrix $\mathbf{A}$ has $L_{2\mathcal{H}}(\mathbf{A}) > 0$ for some $r$-regular $\mathcal{H} \subseteq {[m] \choose k}$ with the SIP, then the following holds for $C_2 > 0$ given by \eqref{Cdef2}:

Fix $\varepsilon < L_2(\mathbf{A}) / C_2$. If for some $n \times \overline m$ matrix $\mathbf{B}$ and map $\pi: \mathcal{H} \mapsto {[\overline m] \choose k}$,
\begin{align}\label{GapUpperBound}
d(\bm{\mathcal{A}}_S, \bm{\mathcal{B}}_{\pi(S)}) \leq \varepsilon, \ \  \text{for $S \in \mathcal{H}$},
\end{align}
then $\overline m \geq m$, and provided $\overline m (r-1) < mr$, there is a permutation matrix $\mathbf{P}$ and invertible diagonal $\mathbf{D}$ such that:
\begin{align}\label{MainLemmaBPD}
\|\mathbf{A}_i - (\mathbf{B}\mathbf{PD})_i\|_2 \leq C_2 \varepsilon, \ \  \text{for } i \in J,
\end{align}
for some $J \subseteq [m]$ of size \mbox{$m - (r-1)(\overline m - m)$}.
\end{lemma}

%\begin{lemma}\label{MainLemma}
%Fix $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}$ with $L_\mathcal{H}(\mathbf{A}) > 0$ for some regular $\mathcal{H} \subseteq {[m] \choose k}$ with the SIP. There exists a constant $C_2 > 0$ for which the following holds for all $\varepsilon < L_2(\mathbf{A}) / C_2$:

%If a matrix $\mathbf{B} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}$ and map $\pi: E \mapsto {m \choose k}$ satisfy:
%\begin{align}\label{GapUpperBound}
%d(\text{\rmfamily span}\{\mathbf{A}_{S}\}, \bm{\mathcal{B}}_{\pi(S)}) \leq \varepsilon, \ \ \text{for $S \in \mathcal{H}$},
%\end{align}
%then there exist a permutation matrix $\mathbf{P}$ and invertible diagonal matrix $\mathbf{D}$ such that:
%\begin{align}\label{MainLemmaBPD}
%\|\mathbf{A}_j - \mathbf{BPD}_j\|_2 \leq C_2 \varepsilon, \ \  \text{for } j \in [m],
%\end{align}
%\end{lemma}

We present the constant $C_2$ (a function of $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathcal{H}$) relative to a quantity used in \cite{Deutsch12} to analyze the convergence of the ``alternating projections" algorithm for projecting a point onto the intersection of subspaces. We incorporate this quantity into the following definition, which we refer to in our proof of Lem.~\ref{DistanceToIntersectionLemma} in the Appendix; specifically, we use it to bound the distance between a point and the intersection of subspaces given an upper bound on its distance from each subspace.

\begin{definition}\label{FriedrichsDefinition}
For a collection of real subspaces $\mathcal{V} = \{V_i\}_{i=1}^\ell$, define $\xi(\mathcal{V}) := 0$ when $|\mathcal{V}| = 1$, and otherwise:
\begin{align}\label{xi}
\xi^2(\mathcal{V}) := 1 -  \max \prod_{i=1}^{\ell-1} \sin^2  \theta \left(V_i, \cap_{j>i} V_j \right) ,
\end{align} 
%
where the maximum is taken over all ways of ordering 
%\footnote{We modify the quantity in \cite{Deutsch12} in this way since the subspace ordering is irrelevant to our purpose.} 
the $V_i$ and the angle $\theta \in (0,\frac{\pi}{2}]$ is defined implicitly as \cite[Def.~9.4]{Deutsch12}:
\begin{align*}
\cos{\theta(U,W)} := \max\left\{ |\langle \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{w} \rangle|: \substack{ \mathbf{u} \in U \cap (U \cap W)^\perp, \ \|\mathbf{u}\|_2 \leq 1 \\ \mathbf{w} \in W \cap (U \cap W)^\perp, \  \|\mathbf{w}\|_2 \leq 1 } \right\}.
\end{align*}
\end{definition}
Note that $\theta \in (0,\frac{\pi}{2}]$ implies $0 \leq \xi < 1$, and that $\xi(\mathcal{V}') \leq \xi(\mathcal{V})$ when $\mathcal{V}' \subseteq \mathcal{V}$.\footnote{We acknowledge the counter-intuitive property: $\theta =  \pi/2$ when $U \subseteq W$.}  

The constant $C_2 > 0$ of Lem.~\ref{MainLemma} can now be expressed as:  
\begin{align}\label{Cdef2}
	C_2(\mathbf{A}, \mathcal{H}) := \frac{ (r+1) \max_{j \in [m]} \|\mathbf{A}_j\|_2}{ 1- \max_{\mathcal{G} \in {\mathcal{H} \choose r+1}} \xi( \bm{\mathcal{A}}_\mathcal{G} ) }.
\end{align}

We next define the constant $C_1 > 0$ of Thm.~\ref{DeterministicUniquenessTheorem} in terms of $C_2$. Given vectors $\mathbf{x}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_N \in \mathbb{R}^m$, let $\mathbf{X}$ denote the $m \times N$ matrix with columns $\mathbf{x}_i$ and let $I(S)$ denote the set of indices $i$ for which $\mathbf{x}_i$ is supported in $S$.  We define:
\begin{align}\label{Cdef1}
C_1(\mathbf{A}, \mathcal{H}, \{\mathbf{x}_i\}_{i=1}^N) := \frac{ C_2(\mathbf{A}, \mathcal{H}) } { \min_{S \in \mathcal{H}} L_k(\mathbf{AX}_{I(S)}) }.
\end{align}
Given the assumptions of Thm.~\ref{DeterministicUniquenessTheorem} on $\mathbf{A}$ and the $\mathbf{x}_i$, this expression for $C_1$ is well-defined\footnote{\label{note1}To see this, fix $S \in \mathcal{H}$ and $k$-sparse $\mathbf{c}$. Using the definitions, we have $\|\mathbf{AX}_{I(S)}\mathbf{c}\|_2 \geq \sqrt{k} L_\mathcal{H}(\mathbf{A})\|\mathbf{X}_{I(S)}\mathbf{c}\|_2 \geq k L_\mathcal{H}(\mathbf{A}) L_k(\mathbf{X}_{I(S)})\|\mathbf{c}\|_2$. Thus, $L_k(\mathbf{AX}_{I(S)}) \geq \sqrt{k} L_\mathcal{H}(\mathbf{A}) L_k(\mathbf{X}_{I(S)}) > 0$, since $L_{\mathcal{H}}(\mathbf{A}) \geq L_{2\mathcal{H}}(\mathbf{A})> 0$ and $L_k(\mathbf{X}_{I(S)}) > 0$ by general linear position of the $\mathbf{x}_i$.} and yields an upper bound on $\varepsilon$ consistent with that proven sufficient in the case $k=1$ considered at the beginning of this section.\footnote{When $\mathbf{x}_i = c_i\mathbf{e}_i$, we have $C_2 \geq 2\|\mathbf{A}_i\|_2$ and the denominator in \eqref{Cdef1} becomes $\min_{i \in [m]} |c_i| \|\mathbf{A}_i\|_2$; hence, $C_1 \geq 2 / \min_{i \in [m]} |c_i|$.}
% C_2(\mathbf{A}, \mathcal{H}) := \frac{ (r+1) \max_{j \in [m]} \|\mathbf{A}_j\|_2}{ \min_{\mathcal{G} \in {\mathcal{H} \choose r} \cup {\mathcal{H} \choose r+1}} \xi( \{ \bm{\mathcal{A}}_S \}

The practically-minded reader should note that the explicit constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ are effectively computable: the denominator of $C_1$ involves a quantity $L_k$ that may be calculated as the smallest singular value of a certain matrix, while computing the quantity $\xi$ in the denominator of $C_2$ involves computing ``canonical angles'' between subspaces, which reduces again to an efficient singular value decomposition.
There is no known fast computation of $L_k$ in general, however, since even $L_{k} > 0$ is NP-hard \cite{tillmann2014computational}, although 
efficiently computable bounds have been proposed (e.g., via the ``mutual coherence" of a matrix \cite{donoho2003optimally}); alternatively, 
fixing $k$ yields polynomial complexity. Moreover, calculating $C_2$ requires an exponential number of queries to $\xi$ unless $r$ is held fixed, too (e.g., the ``cyclic order'' hypergraphs described above have $r=k$).  Thus, as presented, $C_1$ and $C_2$ are not efficiently computable in general. % , but efficient subcases do exist and may be of practical relevance.

\begin{proof}[Proof of Thm.~\ref{DeterministicUniquenessCorollary} for $k < m$] 
We find a map $\pi: \mathcal{H} \to {[m] \choose k}$ for which the distance $d(\bm{\mathcal{A}}_S, \bm{\mathcal{B}}_{\pi(S)})$ is controlled by $\varepsilon$ for all $S \in \mathcal{H}$. Applying Lem.~\ref{MainLemma} then completes the proof.
%We shall show that for every $S \in \mathcal{H}$ there is some $\overline S \in {[\overline m] \choose k}$ for which the distance $d(\bm{\mathcal{A}}_S, \bm{\mathcal{B}}_{\overline S})$ is controlled by $\varepsilon$. Applying Lem.~\ref{MainLemma} with the map $\pi$ defined by $S \mapsto \overline S$ then completes the proof.

Fix $S \in \mathcal{H}$. Since there are more than $(k-1){\overline m \choose k}$ vectors $\mathbf{x}_i$ supported in $S$, by the pigeonhole principle there must be some $\overline S \in {[\overline m] \choose k}$ and a set of $k$ indices $K \subseteq I(S)$ for which all $\mathbf{\overline x}_i$ with $i \in K$ are supported in $\overline S$.
It also follows\footnote{See footnote \ref{note1}.} from $L_{2\mathcal{H}}(\mathbf{A}) > 0$ and the general linear position of the $\mathbf{x}_i$ that $L_k(\mathbf{AX}_{K}) > 0$; that is, the columns of the $n \times k$ matrix $\mathbf{AX}_K$ form a basis for $\bm{\mathcal{A}}_S$. 

Fixing $\mathbf{y} \in \bm{\mathcal{A}}_S \setminus \{\mathbf{0}\}$, there then exists $\mathbf{c} = (c_1, \ldots, c_k) \in \mathbb{R}^k \setminus \{\mathbf{0}\}$ such that $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{AX}_K\mathbf{c}$. Setting \mbox{$\mathbf{\overline{y}} = \mathbf{B\overline{X}}_K\mathbf{c}$, which is in $\bm{\mathcal{B}}_{\overline S}$}, we have by triangle inequality:
\begin{align*}
\|\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{\overline{y}}\|_2 
%&= \|\sum_{i=1}^k c_i(\mathbf{AX}_K - \mathbf{B\overline{X}}_K)_i\|_2
&= \|(\mathbf{AX}_K - \mathbf{B\overline{X}}_K)\mathbf{c}\|_2
%\leq \varepsilon \sum_{i=1}^k |c_i| \\
\leq \varepsilon \|\mathbf{c}\|_1
\leq \varepsilon \sqrt{k}  \|\mathbf{c}\|_2  \\
&\leq \frac{\varepsilon}{L_k(\mathbf{AX}_K)} \|\mathbf{y}\|_2,
\end{align*}
where the last inequality uses \eqref{Ldef}. From Def.~\ref{dDef}:
\begin{align}\label{rhs222}
d(\bm{\mathcal{A}}_S, \bm{\mathcal{B}}_{\overline S}) 
\leq \frac{\varepsilon}{  L_k(\mathbf{AX}_{K}) } 
\leq \frac{\varepsilon}{  L_k(\mathbf{AX}_{I(S)}) } 
\leq \varepsilon \frac{C_1}{C_2}.
\end{align}
%
Finally, apply Lem.~\ref{MainLemma} with $\varepsilon < L_2(\mathbf{A})/C_1$ and $\pi(S) := \overline S$. % L_2(A) > 0 by def of L, since L_2H(A) > 0 and H covers [m]
\end{proof}

Before moving on to the proof of Thm.~\ref{SLCopt}, we briefly revisit our discussion on sample complexity from the end of the previous section. While an exponential number of samples may very well prove to be necessary in the deterministic or almost-certain case, our proof of Thm.~\ref{DeterministicUniquenessTheorem} can be extended to hold with some probability for \emph{any} number of samples by alternative appeal to a probabilistic pigeonholing at the point early in the proof where the (deterministic) pigeonhole principle is applied to show that for every $S \in \mathcal{H}$, there exist $k$ vectors $\mathbf{x}_i$ supported on $S$ whose corresponding $\mathbf{\overline x}_i$ all share the same support.\footnote{A famous example of such an argument is the counter-intuitive ``birthday paradox", which demonstrates that the probability of two people having the same birthday in a room of twenty-three is greater than 50\%.} 
Given insufficient samples, this argument has some less-than-certain probability of being valid for each $S \in \mathcal{H}$. Nonetheless, simulations with small hypergraphs demonstrate that successful recovery is nearly certainly even when $N$ is only a fraction of the deterministic sample complexity (see Fig. \ref{probpigeon}). 

\begin{proof}[Proof of Thm.~\ref{SLCopt}]
We bound the number of $k$-sparse $\mathbf{\overline x}_i$ from below and then apply Thm.~\ref{DeterministicUniquenessCorollary}. 
%We now apply this fact to bound the number of $k$-sparse $\mathbf{\overline x}_i$. 
Let $n_p$ be the number of $\mathbf{\overline x}_i$ with $\|\mathbf{\overline x}_i\|_0 = p$.
Since the $\mathbf{x}_i$ are all $k$-sparse, by \eqref{minsum} we have:
\begin{align*}
%\mbox{$k \sum_{p = 0}^{\overline m} n_p \geq \sum_{i=0}^N \|\mathbf{x}_i\|_0 \geq \sum_{i=0}^N \|\mathbf{\overline x}_i\|_0 = \sum_{p=0}^{\overline m} p n_p.$}
\sum_{p=0}^{\overline m} p n_p =  \sum_{i=0}^N \|\mathbf{\overline x}_i\|_0
\leq \sum_{i=0}^N \|\mathbf{x}_i\|_0 
\leq kN
\end{align*}
Since $N = \sum_{p = 0}^{\overline m} n_p$, we then have $\sum_{p = 0}^{\overline m} (p-k) n_p \leq 0$. Splitting the sum yields:
\begin{align}\label{eqn}
\sum_{p = k+1}^{\overline m} n_p \leq \sum_{p = k+1}^{\overline m} (p-k) n_p \leq \sum_{p = 0}^k (k-p)n_p \leq k \sum_{p = 0}^{k-1} n_p,
\end{align}
%
demonstrating that the number of vectors $\mathbf{\overline x}_i$ that are \emph{not} $k$-sparse is bounded above by how many are $(k-1)$-sparse. 

Next, observe that no more than $(k-1)|\mathcal{H}|$ of the $\mathbf{\overline x}_i$ share a support $\overline S$ of size less than $k$. Otherwise, by the pigeonhole principle, there is some $S \in \mathcal{H}$ and a set of $k$ indices $K \subseteq I(S)$ for which all $\mathbf{x}_i$ with $i \in K$ are supported in $S$; as argued previously, \eqref{rhs222} follows. It is simple to show that $L_2(\mathbf{A}) \leq \max_j\|\mathbf{A}_j\|_2$, and since $0 \leq \xi < 1$, the right-hand side of \eqref{rhs222} is less than one for $\varepsilon < L_2(\mathbf{A})/C_1$. Thus, by \eqref{dimLem} we would have the contradiction $k = \dim(\bm{\mathcal{A}}_S) \leq \dim(\bm{\mathcal{B}}_{\overline S}) \leq |\overline S| < k.$ 

The total number of $(k-1)$-sparse vectors $\mathbf{\overline x}_i$ thus cannot exceed $|\mathcal{H}|(k-1){ \overline m \choose k-1}$. By \eqref{eqn}, no more than $|\mathcal{H}|k(k-1){ \overline m \choose k-1}$ vectors $\mathbf{\overline x}_i$ are not $k$-sparse. Since for every $S \in \mathcal{H}$ there are over $(k-1)\left[ {\overline m \choose k} + |\mathcal{H}|k{ \overline m \choose k-1} \right]$ vectors $\mathbf{x}_i$ supported there, it must be that more than $(k-1){\overline m \choose k}$ of them have corresponding $\mathbf{\overline x}_i$ that are $k$-sparse. The result now follows from Thm.~\ref{DeterministicUniquenessCorollary}, noting by the triangle inequality that $\|\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{B}\mathbf{\overline x}_i\| \leq 2\eta$ for $i = 1, \ldots, N$.

%It can be checked that when this polynomial is nonzero for a substitution of real numbers for the indeterminates, all of the genericity requirements on $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{x}_i$ in our proofs of stability in Thm.~\ref{DeterministicUniquenessTheorem} are satisfied (in particular, the spark condition \eqref{SparkCondition} on $\mathbf{A}$).

\section{Discussion}\label{Discussion}

The main motivation for this work is the observation that characteristic sparse representations seem to emerge from sparse coding models trained over a variety of natural scene datasets by a variety of learning algorithms. The theorems proven here provide some insight into this phenomenon by establishing very general deterministic conditions under which identification of the model parameters is not only possible but also robust to uncertainty.

The guarantees concerning the identification of a dictionary and corresponding sparse codes of minimal average support size (Thm.~\ref{SLCopt}), which is the optimization problem of most interest to practitioners (Prob.~\ref{OptimizationProblem}), are to my knowledge the first of their kind in both the noise-free and noisy domains. It has been shown here that, given sufficient data, this problem reduces to an instance of Prob.~\ref{InverseProblem} to which the main result (Thm.~\ref{DeterministicUniquenessTheorem}) may then be applied: every dictionary and corresponding sparse codes consistent with the data are equivalent up to inherent relabeling/scaling ambiguities and a discrepancy (error) that scales linearly with the measurement noise or modeling inaccuracy. 
In fact, %provided $n \geq \min(2k,m)$, 
in almost all cases these problems are well-posed given a sufficient amount of data (Thm.~\ref{robustPolythm} and Cor.~\ref{ProbabilisticCor}). 
Furthermore, the derived scaling constants are explicit and computable; as such, there is an effective procedure that suffices to affirm if a proposed solution to these problems is indeed unique up to noise and inherent ambiguities, although it is not efficient in general. %Specifically, given a dictionary and sparse codes purported to solve to Prob.~\ref{InverseProblem}, one checks that that they satisfy the corresponding constraints on $\mathbf{A}$ and the $\mathbf{x_i}$ given in the statement of Thm.~\ref{DeterministicUniquenessTheorem}. 



%to the recovery of ``mouse neuronal activity representing location on a track \cite{agarwal2014spatially}

The absence of any assumption at all about dictionaries that solve Prob.~\ref{InverseProblem} was a major technical hurdle. % in proving Thm.~\ref{DeterministicUniquenessTheorem}. 
This very general guarantee was sought because of the practical difficulty of ensuring that an algorithm maintain a dictionary satisfying the spark condition \eqref{SparkCondition} at each iteration, which (to my knowledge) has been explicitly or implicitly assumed in all previous works except \cite{Hillar15}; indeed, even certifying a dictionary has this property is NP-hard \cite{tillmann2014computational}.

Several results in the literature had to be combined to extend the guarantees derived in \cite{Hillar15} into the noisy regime. The main challenge was to generalize Lem.~\ref{MainLemma} to the case where the $k$-dimensional subspaces spanned by corresponding submatrices $\mathbf{A}_S$ and $\mathbf{B}_{\pi(S)}$ are assumed to be``close" but not identical. Unlike the inductive argument in \cite{Hillar15} for the noiseless case, here it had to be explicitly demonstrated that this proximity relation is propagated through iterated intersections right down to the spans of the dictionary elements themselves. Lem.~\ref{DistanceToIntersectionLemma} was designed to encapsulate this fact, and proven by appeal to a convergence guarantee for an alternating projections algorithm first proposed by von Neumann. This result, combined with a little known fact \eqref{eqdim} about the distance metric between subspaces and requiring proof in \cite{Morris10}, constitute the more obscure components of the deduction.

The proof of Lem.~\ref{MainLemma} diverges most significantly from the approach taken in \cite{Hillar15} by way of Lem.~\ref{NonEmptyLemma}, which utilizes a combinatorial design for support sets (the ``singleton intersection property") to reduce the deterministic sample complexity by an exponential factor. This constitutes a significant advance toward legitimizing dictionary learning in practice, since data must otherwise exhibit the exponentially many possible $k$-wise combinations of dictionary elements required by (to my knowledge) all previously published results; although an exponential number of samples per support is still required (unless $k$ is held fixed). The issue in this case is that the map $\pi:\mathcal{H} \to {[m] \choose k}$ is surjective only when $\mathcal{H}$ is taken to be ${[m] \choose k}$, as assumed in \cite{Hillar15} so as to enable an inductive argument, which freely chooses supports in the codomain of $\pi$ to intersect over $(k-1)$ indices to then map back to some corresponding set of $(k-1)$ indices at the intersection of supports in the domain. For $\mathcal{H} \subset {[m] \choose k}$, a bijection between indices had to instead be established here by pigeonholing the image of $\pi$ under constraints imposed by the SIP, which was formulated specifically for this purpose. It just so happened that this more general argument for a non-surjective $\pi$ constrained by the SIP applied just as well to the situation where the number of dictionary elements is over-estimated, in which case a one-to-one correspondence can be guaranteed between a subset of columns of $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ of a size simply expressed in terms of the width of each matrix and the regularity of $\mathcal{H}$. 

One of the mathematically significant achievements in \cite{Hillar15} was to break free from the constraint that the recovery matrix $\mathbf{B}$ satisfy the spark condition in addition to the generating dictionary $\mathbf{A}$. %, in contrast to all previously known uniqueness results which (to my knowledge) have all either explicitly or implicitly made this assumption. 
Here, it has been demonstrated that, in fact, even $\mathbf{A}$ need not satisfy the spark condition! Rather, $\mathbf{A}$ need only be injective on the union of subspaces with supports forming a regular $k$-uniform hypergraph satisfying the SIP (a distinguishing example is given in Sec.~\ref{Results}). This relaxation of constraints inspired the definition of $L_{\mathcal{H}}$ in \eqref{Ldef}, which is a reformulation of the well-known (see footnote \ref{ripfootnote}) restricted matrix lower bound $L_k$ in terms of a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$, and an interesting object for further study in its own right. %(For instance, how hard is it to check that $L_\mathcal{H}(\mathbf{A}) > 0$?) 
%The absence of any restrictions on dictionaries solving Prob.~\ref{InverseProblem} is a major technical obstruction, but highly desirable because of the practical difficulty in ensuring that an algorithm maintain a dictionary satisfying the spark condition \eqref{SparkCondition} at each iteration; indeed, even certifying a dictionary has this property is NP-hard \cite{tillmann2014computational}. 

To reiterate, the methods applied here to prove Thm.~\ref{DeterministicUniquenessTheorem} yield the following results beyond a straightforward extension of those in \cite{Hillar15} to the noisy case:

\begin{enumerate}
\item A reduction in deterministic sample complexity: To identify the $n \times m$ generating dictionary $\mathbf{A}$, it is required in \cite{Hillar15} that $k{m \choose k}$ data points be sampled from each of the ${m \choose k}$ subspaces spanned by subsets of $k$ columns of $\mathbf{A}$. It is shown here that in fact it suffices to sample from at most $m$ such subspaces (see Cor.~\ref{DeterministicUniquenessCorollary}); thus, for fixed $k$, the deterministic sample complexity is polynomial in $m$. 
\item An extension of guarantees to the case where the number of dictionary elements is unknown: The results of \cite{Hillar15} only apply to the case where the matrix $\mathbf{B}$ has the same number of columns as $\mathbf{A}$. It is shown here that if $\mathbf{B}$ has at least as many columns as $\mathbf{A}$ then it contains (up to noise) a subset of the columns of $\mathbf{A}$.
\item Looser requirements (no spark condition) on the generating matrix $\mathbf{A}$: Rather, $\mathbf{A}$ need only be injective on the union of subspaces with supports that form a regular uniform hypergraph satisfying the SIP. 
\end{enumerate}

As it seemed to benefit a reviewer of this work, a brief discussion on how the deterministic sample complexity $N = |\mathcal{H}\left[|(k-1){m \choose k} + 1\right]$ derived in this work compares to those listed in the the top two rows listed in Table I of \cite{Hillar15} may be in order. To be clear, the theory developed here is strictly more general, since $\mathcal{H}$ can always be taken to be ${[m] \choose k}$. The point of difference in this comparison is the assumed set of supports for sparse codes, which is always ${[m] \choose k}$ in \cite{Hillar15}, whereas here it can be assumed to be any regular $k$-uniform hypergraph that satisfies the SIP. By row, %, assuming for our results that sufficient data have been sampled from all supports in a hypergraph H satisfying the SIP:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[I.] The result here improves upon the listed $k{m \choose k}^2$ by an exponential factor, since for every $k < m$ there exists a regular $k$-uniform hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ with $|\mathcal{H}| = m$ satisfying the SIP. 
\item[II.] The result here can be stated with certainty, compared to the commensurate listed $(k+1){m \choose k}$ with almost certainty (i.e. with probability one). The authors in \cite{Hillar15} have applied measure-theoretic arguments to achieve an almost certain result with a reduced sample complexity than that for which certainty can be claimed here by use of combinatorial designs.    
%\item[III.] A direct comparison cannot be made because it is an open question as to the probability that a random set of supports satisfies the SIP. This would be an interesting problem for the community to solve; regardless, the result of \cite{Hillar15} is still implied by the more general theory given here.
%\item[IV.] The result here is $|\mathcal{H}\left[|(k-1){m \choose k} + 1\right]$ with probability one compared to $(k+1){m \choose k}$ with probability one. In this case the sample complexity stated in \cite{Hillar15} is marginally better, but it relies on a noise-free technicality unique to their assumption $\mathcal{H} = {m \choose k}$. %differs in flavor: their $\mathbf{x_i}$ are assumed to be distributed as $(k+1)$ samples per support for every support of size $k \in [m]$, whereas here it is assumed that $(k-1){m \choose k}$ codes $\mathbf{x_i}$ are distributed over each support in some hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ satisfying the SIP. 
%\item[V.] Again, a direct comparison cannot be made for the reason stated for row III.
\end{enumerate}

%Beyond an extension of existing noiseless guarantees \cite{Hillar15} to the noisy regime and their novel application to Prob.~\ref{OptimizationProblem}, this work contains a theory of combinatorial designs for support sets key to identification of dictionaries. This idea is incorporated into a fundamental lemma in matrix theory (Lem.~\ref{MainLemma}) that draws upon the definition of a matrix lower bound (\ref{Ldef}) induced by a hypergraph. As a consequence of this combinatorial approach, recovery of some or all dictionary elements can be guaranteed even if: i) dictionary size is overestimated, ii) data cover only a polynomial number of distinct sparse supports, and iii) dictionaries do not satisfy the spark condition. 

Another reviewer of this work lamented that while the extension from exact recovery to the noisy stability of dictionary learning is significant, the fact that the analysis relies on metrics of the data that are not feasible to compute limits its impact to the scientific community beyond computer science and applied mathematics. What sets the main results of this work apart from the vast majority of results in the field is that they are deterministic, and do not depend on any kind of assumption about the particular random distribution from which the sparse supports, coefficients, or dictionary entries are drawn (though Cor.~\ref{ProbabilisticCor} makes a sweeping statement applicable to all continuous distributions). Consequently, the inferences of those applying dictionary learning methods to inverse problems in their research is justified only in principle; but this is unavoidably the case for NP-hard problems. 

Indeed, theoretical validation makes little practical difference if the methodology is already in widespread use, while practical criteria establishing whether the data models obtained by practitioners are optimal or not would have very high impact. To this end, the work has been laid out for those willing to derive statistical criteria for inference with respect to more domain-specific structured dictionaries and codes (i.e. estimate $C_1$), and reduced by half for those wishing to prove the consistency of any dictionary learning algorithm (i.e. prove convergence to within $\varepsilon(\delta_1,\delta_2)$ given in \eqref{epsdel}). 
%who will derive from our deterministic guarantees the statistical criteria for inference in more domain-specific probabilistic models

Nonetheless, a main reason for the sustained interest in dictionary learning as an unsupervised method for data analysis seems to be the assumed well-posedness of parameter identification in the model, confirmation of which forms the core of these findings. Several groups have applied compressed sensing to signal processing tasks; for instance, in MRI analysis \cite{lustig2008compressed}, image compression \cite{Duarte08}, and even the design of an ultrafast camera \cite{Gao14}. As uniqueness guarantees with minimal assumptions apply to all areas of data science and engineering that utilize learned sparse structure, it is only a matter of time before these systems incorporate dictionary learning to encode and decode signals (e.g., in a device that learns structure from motion \cite{kong2016prior}), just as scientists have used sparse coding to %make sense of their data \cite{jung2001imaging, agarwal2014spatially, lee2016sparse, wu2016stability}. 
uncover latent structure in data (e.g., forgery detection \cite{hughes2010, olshausen2010applied}; brain recordings \cite{jung2001imaging, agarwal2014spatially, lee2016sparse}; and gene expression \cite{wu2016stability}). Assurances offered by these theorems give hope that different devices and algorithms may learn equivalent representations given enough data from statistically identical systems.\footnote{To contrast with the current hot topic of ``Deep Learning'', there are few such uniqueness guarantees for these models of data; moreover, even small noise can dramatically alter their output \cite{goodfellow2014explaining}.} 


Within the field of theoretical neuroscience in particular, dictionary learning for sparse coding and related methods have recovered characteristic components of natural images \cite{Olshausen96, hyvarinen1999fast, bell1997independent, van1998independent} and sounds \cite{bellsejnowski1996, smithlewicki2006, Carlson12} that reproduce response properties of cortical neurons. The results of this work suggest that this correspondence could be due to the ``universality" of sparse representations in natural data, an early mathematical idea in neural theory \cite{pitts1947}. Furthermore, they justify the soundness of one of the few hypothesized theories of bottleneck communication in the brain \cite{Isely10}: that sparse neural population activity is recoverable from its noisy linear compression through a randomly constructed (but unknown) wiring bottleneck by any biologically plausible unsupervised sparse coding method that solves Prob.~\ref{DeterministicUniquenessTheorem} or \ref{SLCopt} (e.g., \cite{rehnsommer2007, rozell2007neurally, pehlevan2015normative}).\footnote{We refer the reader to \cite{ganguli2012compressed} for more on interactions between dictionary learning and neuroscience.}

%The solution to Prob.~\ref{OptimizationProblem}, that of most interest to practitioners of dictionary learning methods, is (to my knowledge) the first of its kind in both the noise-free and noisy domains. 

\section{Future Directions}\label{FutureDirections}

There are many challenges left open by this work. First and foremost, it should be stressed that all conditions stated here which guarantee the uniqueness and stability of sparse representations have only been shown sufficient; it remains open to work out a set of necessary conditions on all fronts, be it on the number of required samples, the structure of support set hypergraphs, or the tolerable signal-to-noise ratio for a bounded recovery error. It is also worth stressing that the deterministic conditions derived here must accommodate always the worst possible cases. It would be of great practical benefit to see how drastically all conditions can be relaxed by requiring less-than-certain guarantees, as (for instance) exhibited in the discussion on probabilistic pigeonholing following the proof of Thm.~\ref{DeterministicUniquenessTheorem}. In a similar vein, the tolerable signal-to-noise ratio can be reduced by considering the probability that noise sampled from a concentrated isotropic distribution will point in a harmful direction, which may be especially low in high-dimensional spaces for certain hypergraphs.

Another interesting remaining challenge is to work out for which special cases it is efficient to check that a solution to Prob.~\ref{InverseProblem} or \ref{OptimizationProblem} is unique up to noise and inherent ambiguities. Considering that the sufficient conditions detailed here are in general NP-hard to compute, are the necessary conditions also NP-hard to compute? Are Probs.~\ref{InverseProblem} and \ref{OptimizationProblem} then also NP-hard (e.g., see \cite{Tillmann15})? Since Prob.~\ref{SLCopt} is intractable in general, but efficiently solvable by convex relaxation when the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is known (and has a large enough lower bound over sparse domains \cite{eldar2012compressed}), is there a version of Thm.~\ref{SLCopt} that lays down general conditions under which Prob.~\ref{OptimizationProblem} can be solved efficiently in full by similar means?  % [*** Incorporate this open problem with more words ***]

%Finally, it was noted that the combinatorial approach applied here allows for guaranteed recovery of some or all dictionary elements even if the dictionary is overestimated (i.e. $\overline m > m$). What if it is underestimated?  How then would the recovered dictionary elements relate to the original columns of $\mathbf{A}$?

%Our results suggest that this correspondence could be due to the ``universality'' of sparse representations in natural data, an early idea in neural theory \cite{pitts1947}. 

I briefly expand on some of these directions below. It is my hope that these remaining challenges pique the interest of the community, and that the theoretical tools showcased here can be applied to derive practical guidelines supporting sparse coding analyses. 

% THIS SECTION ADDRESSES REVIEWER COMPLAINTS:

\subsection{Signal-to-Noise Ratio}

A concern raised in peer review of this work was the typical size of the constant $C_1$, which sets the tolerable signal-to-noise ratio for dictionary and code recovery up to an acceptable error. Referring to the definition of this constant in \eqref{Cdef1}, the reader should note that the denominator involves $L_k$, a standard quantity in the field of compressed sensing (the ``restricted isometry constant", see footnote \ref{ripfootnote}), which is known to be reasonable for many random distributions generating dictionaries $\mathbf{A}$ and sparse codes $\mathbf{x}_i$ \cite{baraniuk2008simple}. The numerator $C_2$, on the other hand, incorporates the more obscure quantity $\xi$ defined in \eqref{FriedrichsDefinition}, which is computed from the ``Friedrichs angle" between certain spans of subsets of the columns of $\mathbf{A}$. Simulations for small (pseudo-)randomly generated dictionaries $\mathbf{A}$ suggest nonetheless that the constant $C_2$ is likely reasonable in general as well (at least for the case where $m=k^2$ and $\mathcal{H}$ is taken to be the set of rows and columns formed by arranging the elements of $[m]$ in a square grid; see Fig. \ref{reasonableC2}). These observations motivate the following conjecture:

\begin{conjecture}
For all $t > 0$,
\begin{equation*}
Pr[ \left| C_2- \mathbb{E}[C_2 ] \right| > t] \to 0 \ \ \text{as $k \to \infty$ and $k/m \to 0$} 
\end{equation*}
provided the assumptions of Thm. \ref{DeterministicUniquenessTheorem} are satisfied.
\end{conjecture}
%Finally, the error bounds can be improved by tightening the constant $C_1$, e.g. via an improvement in Lemma ?.
%$C_1 = C_1(\mathbf{A}, \mathcal{H}, \{ \mathbf{x_i} \}_{i=0}^N)$

\subsection{Sample Complexity}

It is possible to tighten the pigeonholing argument in the proof of Thm.~\ref{DeterministicUniquenessTheorem} and reduce the deterministic sample complexity without recourse to uncertainty as previously suggested. The argument iterates over supports $S \in \mathcal{H}$, in each case determining a corresponding support $\overline S \in {[\overline m] \choose k}$ without consideration of previously matched support pairs; and yet the assumption $L_{2\mathcal{H}}(\mathbf{A}) > 0$ implies that no two supports in $\mathcal{H}$ can map to the same $\overline S$. Thus the number of bins to pigeonhole into decreases every iteration, though this is a drop in a bucket of exponential size. It would be interesting to see how much the deterministic sample complexity can be reduced by imposing these constraints holistically, given the specific structure of the hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$.

Incidentally, there is also room to breathe in the restrictions on $\mathcal{H}$. Already, the results of this work motivate the following question, which is only one among many combinatorial problems brought to mind by the SIP:
\begin{question}
Fix integers $m$ and $k < m$. What is the smallest regular hypergraph $\mathcal{H} \subseteq {[m] \choose k}$ satisfying the SIP?
\end{question}

A close examination of Lemma \ref{NonEmptyLemma} reveals, however, that $\mathcal{H}$ need not be regular so long as it satisfies a constraint on the sequence of node degrees to remain compatible with the iterative argument. It is then natural to ask: what are the necessary constraints on $\mathcal{H}$, and what is the smallest hypergraph satisfying these constraints for given $m$ and $k$?

Opening ourselves up to uncertainty, we can furthermore ask:
\begin{question}\label{probofsip}
Fix $k < m$. What is the probability that a random subset of ${[m] \choose k}$ contains a regular hypergraph satisfying the SIP?
\end{question}

We can also elaborate on the probabilistic pigeonholing strategy outlined in the discussion following the proof of Thm.~\ref{DeterministicUniquenessTheorem}. The problem is to count the number of ways in which vectors supported in $S \in \mathcal{H}$ can be partitioned among supports $\overline S \in {\overline m \choose k}$ without allocating $k$ or more to any individual $\overline S$ (in which case the logic of the proof stalls; we are interested in the probability that it doesn't). These are integer solutions to the problem $\sum_i n_i = N$ subject to $n_i < k$ for all $i$, where $i = 1, \ldots, {\overline m \choose k}$. Following verbatim the exposition in \cite{stackexchangeanswer} It appears there is no closed formula for this problem, but the number of solutions can be computed in a number of operations independent of $N$. Writing $p = {\overline m \choose k}$, the number is the coefficient of $X^N$ in the polynomial $(1 + X + \ldots + X^{k-1})^p$. Written as a rational function of $X$, 

\begin{equation*}
(1 + X + \ldots + X^{k-1})^p = \left(\frac{1 - X^k}{1 - X} \right)^p = \frac{\left(1 - X^k \right)^p}{\left(1 - X\right)^p}
\end{equation*}
the coeffiecient of $X^i$ in the numerator is zero unless $i$ is a multiple $qk$ of $k$, in which case it is $(-1)^q{p \choose q}$, and the coefficient of $X^j$ in the inverse of the denominator is $(-1)^j {-p \choose j} = {j + p-1 \choose j}$, which is zero unless $j \geq 0$ and otherwise equal to ${j + p-1 \choose p-1}$. It remains to sum over all $i + j = N$, which gives:

\begin{equation*}
\sum_{q=0}^{\text{min}(p, N/k)} (-1)^q {p \choose q} {N - qk + p - 1 \choose p - 1}
\end{equation*}
where the summation is truncated to ensure that $N - qk \geq 0$ (the condition $j \geq 0$) and has at most $p+1 = {\overline m \choose k} + 1$ terms.

The total number of ways to pigeonhole is ${N +p- 1 \choose p - 1}$, and so the probability of full recovery is $\left(1 - (\text{num. stalls}) / (\text{num. total}) \right)^{|\mathcal{H}|}$ (see Fig. \ref{probpigeon}). 
While it may very well be impossible to to exorcise exponentiality from the number of required samples in the deterministic or almost-certain case, the figure suggests it may be possible with high-probability by one way or another. Informally,

\begin{question}
While fixing $k$ yields polynomial deterministic sample complexity in $m$ (see Cor.~\ref{DeterministicUniquenessCorollary}), is there some more general probablistic sense (perhaps for some restricted class of hypergraphs) by which sample complexity is polynomial in both $m$ and $k$?
\end{question}
%Referring to Fig. \ref{probpigeon}, which computes these probabilities for some small hypergraphs, one is led to wonder if it may be possible to exorcise exponentiality from the sample complexity asymptotically in this way or another. 


%\begin{question}
%Is there a class of hypergraphs $\mathcal{H} = \mathcal{H}(m,k)$ and a polynomial $p(m,k)$ such that $N \geq p(m,k)$ implies successful dictionary and code recovery with a probability approaching one for generic $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{x}_i$ supported in $\mathcal{H}$ as $m \to \infty$?
%Is there a class of hypergraphs $\mathcal{H}$ for which a number of samples $N$ polynomial in both $m$ and $k$ suffices to guarantee stable recovery of $\mathbf{A}$ and sparse codes $\mathbf{x}_i$ as $k/m \to 0$?
%\end{question}

\subsection{Convex Optimization}

A commonly applied workaround to the intractability of Prob.~\ref{SLCopt} (see \cite{tillmann2015computational}) is to swap out the norm $\|\cdot\|_0$ in \eqref{minsum} for $\|\cdot\|_1$, thereby transforms the inference of sparse $\mathbf{\overline x}_i$ for a given $\mathbf{B}$ into a convex optimization solvable by a linear program. A major advance in compressive sensing was the discovery that \eqref{minsum} can in fact be solved in this way for fixed $\mathbf{B}$ provided $L_{2k}(\mathbf{B})$ is large enough. The current work provides conditions on the generating dictionary $\mathbf{A}$ and $k$-sparse codes $\mathbf{x}_i$ under which \emph{all} matrices $\mathbf{B}$ (of bounded column-norm) that solve Prob.~\ref{OptimizationProblem} have $L_{2k}(\mathbf{B})$ bounded from below; specifically, $L_{2k}(\mathbf{B}) \geq \left(L_{2k}(\mathbf{A}) - C_1\varepsilon \right) / \|\mathbf{D}\|_1$ in the case where $\mathbf{A}$ satisfies \eqref{SparkCondition}. Thus, there is some noise bound inside of which all solutions to Prob.~\ref{OptimizationProblem} are solutions to the convexified problem as well. It remains to determine which practical constraints would preclude matrices from solving the convexified problem without solving Prob.~\ref{OptimizationProblem}.
%

% SOLUTION CHECKING ALGORITHM:
%\begin{enumerate}
 %  \item For each $\mathbf{x_i}$, determine its support $S$ and increment a counter corresponding to that support.
  % \item For each support $S$ with count greater than $(k-1){m \choose k}$, check the $\mathbf{x_i}$ supported there are in general linear position (i.e. the determinant of the matrix having $\mathbf{x}_i$ as its columns is nonzero) and discard $S$ if not.
 %  \item Check the remaining set of supports satisfies the SIP. 
  % \item If so, list all of its regular $k$-uniform sub-hypergraphs and discard those for which $L_{2\mathcal{H}}(\mathbf{A}) = 0$. 
  % \item For each of the remaining hypergraphs, compute the constant $C_1$ from $\mathbf{A}$ and the $\mathbf{x_i}$.% (or for every subset of the  $\mathbf{x_i}$ of size $(k-1){m \choose k}$).
 %  \item Check that $\varepsilon < L_2(\mathbf{A})$. If yes, the solution is "unique".

\section{Appendix}\label{proofs}

We prove Lem.~\ref{MainLemma} after the following auxiliary lemmas.  % stating and proving some auxiliary lemmas. 
%First, note that since $\|\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}\|_2 \leq \max_j\|\mathbf{A}_j\|_2\|\mathbf{x}\|_1$ and $\|\mathbf{x}\|_1 \leq \sqrt{k} \|\mathbf{x}\|_2$ for $k$-sparse $\mathbf{x}$, by \eqref{Ldef} we have the following frequently applied inequality:
%\begin{align}\label{delrho}
%L_{k'}(\mathbf{A}) \leq  \max_j\|\mathbf{A}_j\|_2 \ \ \text{for all $k' \leq 2k$}.
%\end{align}

% and then sketch the proofs of Thm.~\ref{robustPolythm} and Cor.~\ref{ProbabilisticCor}.

%\begin{lemma}\label{spanIntersectionLemma}
%Let $\mathbf{M} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}$. If every $2k$ columns of $\mathbf{M}$ are linearly independent, then for any $F \subseteq {[m] \choose k}$:
%\begin{align*}
%\text{\rmfamily span}\{\mathbf{M}_{\cap F}\}  = \bigcap_{S \in F} \text{\rmfamily span}\{\mathbf{M}_S\}.
%\end{align*}
%\end{lemma}
%\begin{proof}
%Using induction on $|F|$, it is enough to prove the lemma when $|F| = 2$; but this case follows directly from the assumption.
%\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{spanIntersectionLemma}
If $f: V \to W$ is injective, then $f\left(\cap_{i=1}^\ell V_i \right) =  \cap_{i=1}^\ell f\left(V_i\right)$ for any $V_1, \ldots, V_\ell \subseteq V$. ($f(\emptyset):=\emptyset$.)
%In particular, if for some $E \in 2^{[m]}$ the map $M \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}$ is injective on $\cup_{S \in \mathcal{H}} \text{span}\{e_i\}_{i \in S}$ then $\text{span}\{ M_{\cap_{S \in \mathcal{H}} S} \} = \cap_{S \in \mathcal{H}} \text{span}\{M_S\}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
By induction, it is enough to prove the case $\ell = 2$. Clearly, for any map $f$, if $w \in f(U \cap V)$ then $w \in f(U)$ and $w \in f(V)$; hence, $w \in f(U) \cap f(V)$. If $w \in f(U) \cap f(V)$, then $w \in f(U)$ and $w \in f(V)$; thus, $w = f(u) = f(v)$ for some $u \in U$ and $v \in V$, implying $u = v$ by injectivity of $f$. It follows that $u \in U \cap V$ and $w \in f(U \cap V)$.
\end{proof}
In particular, if a matrix $\mathbf{A}$ satisfies $L_{2\mathcal{H}}(\mathbf{A}) > 0$, then taking $V$ to be the union of subspaces consisting of vectors with supports in $2\mathcal{H}$, we have $\bm{\mathcal{A}}_{\cap \mathcal{G}} = \cap \bm{\mathcal{A}}_\mathcal{G}$ for all $\mathcal{G} \subseteq \mathcal{H}$.
% \vspace{-.4 cm}

\begin{lemma}\label{DistanceToIntersectionLemma}
Let $\mathcal{V} = \{V_i\}_{i=1}^k$ be a set of two or more subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^m$, and set $V = \cap \mathcal{V} $. For  $\mathbf{u} \in \mathbb{R}^m$, we have (recall Defs.~\ref{dDef}~\&~\ref{FriedrichsDefinition}):
\begin{align}\label{DTILeq}
\text{\rmfamily dist}(\mathbf{u}, V) \leq \frac{1}{1 - \xi(\mathcal{V})} \sum_{i=1}^k \text{\rmfamily dist}(\mathbf{u}, V_i).
\end{align}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof} 
% When $V = \{\mathbf{0}\}$, the result is trivial, so suppose otherwise.  
Recall the projection onto the subspace $V \subseteq \mathbb{R}^m$ is the mapping $\Pi_V: \mathbb{R}^m \to V$ that associates with each $\mathbf{u}$ its unique nearest point in $V$; i.e., $\|\mathbf{u} - \Pi_V\mathbf{u}\|_2 = \text{\rmfamily dist}(\mathbf{u}, V)$.
By repeatedly applying the triangle inequality, we have:
\begin{align}\label{f}
\|\mathbf{u} - &\Pi_V\mathbf{u}\|_2 
\leq \|\mathbf{u} - \Pi_{V_k} \mathbf{u}\|_2 + \|\Pi_{V_k}  \mathbf{u} - \Pi_{V_k}\Pi_{V_{k-1}}\mathbf{u}\|_2 \nonumber \\
&\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ + \cdots + \|\Pi_{V_k} \Pi_{V_{k-1}}\cdots \Pi_{V_1} \mathbf{u} - \Pi_V \mathbf{u}\|_2 \nonumber \\
&\leq  \sum_{\ell=1}^k \|\mathbf{u} - \Pi_{V_{\ell}} \mathbf{u}\|_2 
+ \|(\Pi_{V_k}\cdots\Pi_{V_{1}} - \Pi_V) \mathbf{u}\|_2,
\end{align}
where we have also used that the spectral norm of the orthogonal projections $\Pi_{V_{\ell}}$ satisfies $\|\Pi_{V_{\ell}}\|_2 \leq 1$ for all $\ell$. 

It remains to bound the second term in \eqref{f} by $\xi(\mathcal{V}) \|\mathbf{u} - \Pi_V\mathbf{u}\|_2$. First, note that $\Pi_{V_\ell} \Pi_V = \Pi_V$ and $\Pi_V^2 = \Pi_V$, so we have $\|(\Pi_{V_k} \cdots \Pi_{V_1} - \Pi_V) \mathbf{u} \|_2 
= \| ( \Pi_{V_k} \cdots\Pi_{V_1} - \Pi_V ) (\mathbf{u} - \Pi_V\mathbf{u})\|_2$. % \leq z\|\mathbf{u} - \Pi_V\mathbf{u}\|_2$.
Consequently, inequality \eqref{DTILeq} follows from \cite[Thm.~9.33]{Deutsch12}:
\begin{align}
\|\Pi_{V_k}\Pi_{V_{k-1}}\cdots\Pi_{V_1} \mathbf{x} - \Pi_V\mathbf{x}\|_2 \leq z \|\mathbf{x}\|_2, \ \ \text{for all } \mathbf{x},
\end{align}
with \mbox{$z^2= 1 - \prod_{\ell =1}^{k-1}(1-z_{\ell}^2)$} and \mbox{$z_{\ell} = \cos\theta\left(V_{\ell}, \cap_{s=\ell+1}^k V_s\right)$} (recall $\theta$ from Def.~\ref{FriedrichsDefinition}), after substituting $\xi(\mathcal{V})$ for $z$ and rearranging terms.
\end{proof}
\begin{lemma}\label{NonEmptyLemma} 
Fix an $r$-regular hypergraph $\mathcal{H} \subseteq 2^{[m]}$ satisfying the SIP. If the map $\pi: \mathcal{H} \to 2^{[\overline m]}$ has $\sum_{S \in \mathcal{H}} |\pi(S)| \geq \sum_{S \in \mathcal{H}} |S|$ and:
\begin{align}\label{cond}
	|\cap \pi(\mathcal{G})| \leq |\cap \mathcal{G} |,\ \ \   \text{for } \mathcal{G} \in {\mathcal{H} \choose r} \cup {\mathcal{H} \choose r+1},

then $\overline m \geq m$; and if $\overline m  (r-1) < mr$, the map $i \mapsto \cap_{S \in \sigma(i)} \pi(S)$ is an injective function to $[\overline m]$ from some $J \subseteq [m]$ of size $m - (r-1)(\overline m - m)$ (recall $\sigma$ from Def.~\ref{sip}).  %In particular, if $\overline m = m$ then $\pi$ is induced by a permutation on $[m]$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Consider the following set: $T_1 := \{(i, S): i \in \pi(S), S \in \mathcal{H}\}$, which numbers $|T_1| = \sum_{S \in \mathcal{H}} |\pi(S)| \geq \sum_{S \in \mathcal{H}} |S| = \sum_{i \in [m]} \deg_\mathcal{H}(i) = mr$ by $r$-regularity of $\mathcal{H}$. Note that $|T_1| \leq \overline m r$; otherwise, pigeonholing the tuples of $T_1$ with respect to their $\overline m$ possible first elements would imply that more than $r$ of the tuples in $T_1$ share the same first element. This cannot be the case, however, since then some $\mathcal{G} \in {\mathcal{H} \choose r+1}$ formed from any $r+1$ of their second elements would satisfy $\cap \pi(\mathcal{G}) \neq 0$; hence, $|\cap \mathcal{G}| \neq 0$ by \eqref{cond}, contradicting $r$-regularity of $\mathcal{H}$. It follows that $\overline m \geq m$.

Suppose now that $\overline m (r-1) < mr$, so that $p := mr - \overline m (r-1)$ is positive and $|T_1| \geq \overline m (r - 1) + p$. Pigeonholing $T_1$ into $[\overline m]$ again, there are at least $r$ tuples in $T_1$ sharing some first element; that is, for some $\mathcal{G}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{H}$ of size $|\mathcal{G}_1| \geq r$, we have $|\cap \pi(\mathcal{G}_1)| \geq 1$ and (by \eqref{cond}) $|\cap \mathcal{G}_1| \geq 1$. Since no more than $r$ tuples of $T_1$ can share the same first element, we in fact have $|\mathcal{G}_1| = r$. It follows by $r$-regularity that $\mathcal{G}_1$ is a star of $\mathcal{H}$; hence, $|\cap \mathcal{G}_1| = 1$ by the SIP and $|\cap \pi(\mathcal{G}_1)|  = 1$ by \eqref{cond}.

If $p=1$, then we are done. Otherwise, define $T_2 := T_1 \setminus \{(i,S) \in T_1: i = \cap \pi(\mathcal{G}_1)\}$, which contains $|T_2| = |T_1| - r \geq (\overline m - 1)(r-1) + (p-1)$ ordered pairs having $\overline m - 1$ distinct first indices. Pigeonholing $T_2$ into $[\overline m - 1]$ and repeating the above arguments produces the star $\mathcal{G}_2 \in {\mathcal{H} \choose r}$ with intersection $\cap \mathcal{G}_2$ necessarily distinct (by $r$-regularity) from $\cap \mathcal{G}_1$. Iterating this procedure $p$ times in total yields the stars $\mathcal{G}_i$ for which $\cap\mathcal{G}_i \mapsto \cap \pi(\mathcal{G}_i)$ defines an injective map to $[\overline m]$ from $J = \{\cap \mathcal{G}_1, \ldots, \cap \mathcal{G}_p\} \subseteq [m]$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Lem.~\ref{MainLemma}]
%We will show that the bound \eqref{GapUpperBound} trickles through the intersection semi-lattices of $\{\bm{\mathcal{A}}_S\}_{S \in \mathcal{H}}$ and $\{\bm{\mathcal{B}}_{\overline S}\}_{\overline S \in \pi(\mathcal{H})}$ to yield \eqref{MainLemmaBPD} by virtue of the SIP.  
We begin by showing that $\dim(\bm{\mathcal{B}}_{\pi(S)}) = \dim(\bm{\mathcal{A}}_S)$ for all $S \in \mathcal{H}$. Note that since $\|\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}\|_2 \leq \max_j\|\mathbf{A}_j\|_2\|\mathbf{x}\|_1$ and $\|\mathbf{x}\|_1 \leq \sqrt{k} \|\mathbf{x}\|_2$ for all $k$-sparse $\mathbf{x}$, by \eqref{Ldef} we have $L_2(\mathbf{A}) \leq \max_j\|\mathbf{A}_j\|_2$ and therefore (as $0 \leq \xi < 1$) the right-hand side of \eqref{GapUpperBound} is less than one. From \eqref{dimLem}, we have $|\pi(S)| \geq \dim(\bm{\mathcal{B}}_{\pi(S)}) \geq \dim(\bm{\mathcal{A}}_S) = |S|$, the final equality holding by injectivity of $\mathbf{A}_S$. As $|\pi(S)| = |S|$, the claim follows. Note, therefore, that $\mathbf{B}_{\pi(S)}$ has full-column rank for all $S \in \mathcal{H}$.

We next demonstrate that \eqref{cond} holds. Fixing $\mathcal{G} \in {\mathcal{H} \choose r} \cup {\mathcal{H} \choose r+1}$, it suffices to show that $d(\bm{\mathcal{B}}_{\cap \pi(\mathcal{G})}, \bm{\mathcal{A}}_{\cap \mathcal{G}} ) < 1$, since by \eqref{dimLem} we then have $|\cap \pi(\mathcal{G})| = \dim(\bm{\mathcal{B}}_{\cap \pi(\mathcal{G})}) \leq \dim(\bm{\mathcal{A}}_{\cap \mathcal{G}}) = |\cap \mathcal{G}|$, with equalities from the full column-ranks of $\mathbf{A}_{S}$ and $\mathbf{B}_{\pi(S)}$ for all $S \in \mathcal{H}$.\footnote{Note that if ever $\bm{\mathcal{B}}_{\cap \pi(\mathcal{G})} \neq /bfseries 0$ while $\cap \mathcal{G} = \emptyset$, we would have $d(\bm{\mathcal{B}}_{\cap \pi(\mathcal{G})}, \bm 0 ) = 1$. However, that leads to a contradiction.} Observe that $d(\bm{\mathcal{B}}_{\cap \pi(\mathcal{G})}, \bm{\mathcal{A}}_{\cap \mathcal{G}}  ) 
\leq d\left( \cap \bm{\mathcal{B}}_{\pi(\mathcal{G})}, \cap \bm{\mathcal{A}}_\mathcal{G} \right)$ by \eqref{UsubU}, since trivially $\bm{\mathcal{B}}_{\cap \pi(\mathcal{G})} \subseteq \cap \bm{\mathcal{B}}_{\pi(\mathcal{G})}$ and also $\bm{\mathcal{A}}_{\cap \mathcal{G}} = \cap \bm{\mathcal{A}}_\mathcal{G}$ by Lem.~\ref{spanIntersectionLemma}. Recalling Def.~\ref{dDef} and applying Lem.~\ref{DistanceToIntersectionLemma} yields:
\begin{align}
d\left( \cap \bm{\mathcal{B}}_{\pi(\mathcal{G})}, \cap \bm{\mathcal{A}}_\mathcal{G} \right)
&\leq \max_{\mathbf{u} \in \cap \bm{\mathcal{B}}_{\pi(\mathcal{G})}, \ \|\mathbf{u}\|_2 \leq 1} \sum_{S \in \mathcal{G}} \frac{ \text{\rmfamily dist}\left( \mathbf{u},\bm{\mathcal{A}}_{S} \right) }{ 1 - \xi( \bm{\mathcal{A}}_\mathcal{G} ) } \nonumber \\
&= \sum_{S \in \mathcal{G}} \frac{ d\left( \cap \bm{\mathcal{B}}_{\pi(\mathcal{G})},\bm{\mathcal{A}}_{S} \right) }{ 1 - \xi( \bm{\mathcal{A}}_\mathcal{G} ) }, \nonumber
\end{align}
passing the maximum through the sum.
Since $\cap \bm{\mathcal{B}}_{\pi(\mathcal{G})} \subseteq \bm{\mathcal{B}}_{\pi(S)}$ for all $S \in \mathcal{G}$, by \eqref{UsubU} the numerator of each term in the sum above is bounded by \mbox{$d\left( \bm{\mathcal{B}}_{\pi(S)},\bm{\mathcal{A}}_{S} \right) = d\left(\bm{\mathcal{A}}_{S}, \bm{\mathcal{B}}_{\pi(S)} \right) \leq \varepsilon$}, with the equality from \eqref{eqdim} since $\dim(\bm{\mathcal{B}}_{\pi(S)}) = \dim(\bm{\mathcal{A}}_S)$. Thus, altogether:
\begin{align}\label{last}
d(\bm{\mathcal{B}}_{\cap \pi(\mathcal{G})}, \bm{\mathcal{A}}_{\cap \mathcal{G}} )
\leq \frac{|\mathcal{G}| \varepsilon}{1 - \xi( \bm{\mathcal{A}}_\mathcal{G} )}
\leq \frac{C_2 \varepsilon}{\max_j\|\mathbf{A}_j\|_2},
\end{align}
recalling the definition of $C_2$ in \eqref{Cdef2}. Lastly, since $C_2 \varepsilon < L_2(\mathbf{A}) \leq \max_j\|\mathbf{A}_j\|_2$, we have $d(\bm{\mathcal{B}}_{\cap \pi(\mathcal{G})}, \bm{\mathcal{A}}_{\cap \mathcal{G}} ) \leq 1$ and therefore \eqref{cond} holds.

%Keeping in mind that $d(U',V) \leq d(U,V)$ whenever $U' \subseteq U$ and applying (in order) Lem.~\ref{spanIntersectionLemma}, Lem.~\ref{DistanceToIntersectionLemma}, \eqref{eqdim}, \eqref{GapUpperBound}, and \eqref{Cdef2} gives:
%\begin{align}\label{randoml}
%d(&\bm{\mathcal{B}}_{\cap \pi(\mathcal{G})}, \bm{\mathcal{A}}_{\cap \mathcal{G}}  ) 
%\leq d\left( \cap \bm{\mathcal{B}}_{\pi(\mathcal{G})}, \cap \bm{\mathcal{A}}_\mathcal{G} \right)
%\leq \sum_{T \in \mathcal{G}} \frac{ d\left( \cap \bm{\mathcal{B}}_{\pi(\mathcal{G})},\bm{\mathcal{A}}_{T} \right) }{ 1 - \xi( \bm{\mathcal{A}}_\mathcal{G} ) } \nonumber \\
%&\leq \sum_{T \in \mathcal{G}} \frac{ d\left( \bm{\mathcal{B}}_{\pi(T)},\bm{\mathbf{A}}_{T} \right) }{ 1 - \xi( \bm{\mathcal{A}}_\mathcal{G} ) }
%\leq \frac{|\mathcal{G}| \varepsilon}{1 - \xi( \bm{\mathcal{A}}_\mathcal{G} )} 
%\leq \frac{C_2 \varepsilon}{\max_j\|\mathbf{A}_j\|_2},
%\end{align}
%
%which is less than one, since $C_2 \varepsilon < L_2(\mathbf{A}) \leq \max_j\|\mathbf{A}_j\|_2$.

Applying Lem.~\ref{NonEmptyLemma}, the association $i \mapsto \cap_{S \in \sigma(i)} \pi(S)$ is an injective map $\overline \pi: J \to [\overline m]$ for some $J \subseteq [m]$ of size $m - (r-1)(\overline m - m)$, and $\mathbf{B}_{\overline \pi(i)} \neq \mathbf{0}$ for all $i \in J$ since the columns of $\mathbf{B}_{\pi(S)}$ are linearly independent for all $S \in \mathcal{H}$. Letting $\overline \varepsilon := C_2 \varepsilon / \max_i \|\mathbf{A}_i\|_2$, it follows from \eqref{eqdim} and \eqref{last} that $d\left( \bm{\mathcal{A}}_i, \bm{\mathcal{B}}_{\overline \pi(i)} \right) = d\left(\bm{\mathcal{B}}_{\overline \pi(i)},  \bm{\mathcal{A}}_i \right)  \leq \overline \varepsilon$ for all $i \in J$. %Fixing $\overline \varepsilon = C_2\varepsilon$ and letting $c_i = \|\mathbf{A}_i\|_2^{-1}$, we thus have that for each $\mathbf{e}_i \in \mathbb{R}^m$ with $i \in J$ there exists some $\overline{c}_i \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $\|c_i\mathbf{A}\mathbf{e}_i - \overline{c}_i \mathbf{B}\mathbf{e}_{\overline \pi(i)}\|_2 \leq \overline \varepsilon < L_2(\mathbf{A}) \min_{i\in J} |c_i|$. But this is exactly the supposition in \eqref{1D}, and the result follows from the case $k=1$ in Sec.~\ref{DUT} applied to the submatrix $\mathbf{A}_J$. 
Setting $c_i := \|\mathbf{A}_i\|_2^{-1}$ so that $\|c_i\mathbf{Ae}_i\|_2 = 1$, by Def.~\ref{dDef} for all $i \in J$:
\begin{align*}
\min_{\overline c_i \in \mathbb{R}} \|c_i\mathbf{Ae}_i - \overline c_i \mathbf{Be}_{\overline \pi(i)} \|_2
\leq d\left( \bm{\mathcal{A}}_i, \bm{\mathcal{B}}_{\overline \pi(i)} \right)
\leq \overline \varepsilon,
%&= \max_{\bm{u} \in \bm{\mathcal{A}}_i, \|\bm{u}\|_2 \leq 1} \text{dist}\left(\bm{u}, \bm{\mathcal{B}}_{\overline \pi(i)} \right) \\
%&\geq  \text{dist}\left(c_i\bm{Ae}_i, \mathbf{Be}_{\overline \pi(i)} \right) \\
%&= \min_{\overline c_i \in \mathbb{R}} \|c_i\bm{Ae}_i - \overline c_i \mathbf{Be}_{\overline \pi(i)} \|_2
\end{align*}
%
for $\overline \varepsilon < L_2(\mathbf{A})\min_{i \in [m]}|c_i|$. But this is exactly the supposition in \eqref{1D}, with $J$ and $\overline \varepsilon$ in place of $[m]$ and $\varepsilon$, respectively. The same arguments of the case $k=1$ in Sec.~\ref{DUT} can then be made to show that for any $\overline m \times \overline m$ permutation and invertible diagonal matrices $\mathbf{P}$ and $\mathbf{D}$ with, respectively, columns $\mathbf{e}_{\pi(i)}$ and $\frac{\overline{c}_i}{c_i}\mathbf{e}_i$ for $i \in J$ (otherwise, $\mathbf{e}_{i}$ for $i \in [\overline{m}] \setminus J$), we have $\|\mathbf{A}_i - (\mathbf{B}\mathbf{PD})_i \|_2 \leq \overline  \varepsilon / |c_i|  \leq C_2 \varepsilon$ for all $i \in J$.
