%I want to dedicate this to my dad. At the same time, I don't want to, because the results on display here can't be matched to the time with him I traded to produce them, and it feels as though dedicating this work to him would be measuring his life up against them. These theorems, while fundamental, are just something people might cite to feel better about the sparse coding analyses they were already going to do, anyway. And yet, despite total freedom offered by the Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, I worried the brain was so dauntingly complex that I should feel lucky to have at last been offered a well-defined relevant problem to work on, particularly one I felt even remotely equipped to solve myself, so as to feel deserving of a Ph.D. from UC Berkeley. The fact is that whatever the eventual effect of this work on the scientific ecosystem, these truths could have waited, arrived at their own pace, via myself or another, and I could have been more present with my dad as he waited for death. I couldn't really fathom what it actually meant for him to die, to never see or talk to or hug him again, while the idea of putting original work out there, of crafting my own piece of the overwhelming puzzle that is neuroscience, was tantalizing. Let's say, then, that this dedication is the first bit of a life's work, real work void of any prestigious position or degree and the associated self-doubt and pressure, put toward passionate id	eas, solving problems I care about and that actually matter, loving and caring for others or, as my dad would say, ``being a mensch". May this dedication serve to hold myself publicly accountable to that. Also I love you, mom. I dedicate and don't dedicate this and everything to come to you, too.
